    "detailed_description": "Angot is a display typeface that combines a geometric construction with playful, almost whimsical details. The letters are built on a grid system, resulting in a clean and modern aesthetic. However, the addition of small, decorative elements, such as the subtle serifs on the lowercase 'a' and 'g', and the unique, almost pixelated, outline of each character, adds a touch of personality and whimsy. This combination of geometric precision and playful details gives Angot a unique character, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from branding and logos to headlines and posters. The font's bold and distinctive style evokes a sense of fun and energy, making it ideal for projects that require a playful and attention-grabbing aesthetic. The font's versatility allows it to be used in both traditional and digital contexts, making it a valuable tool for designers working across various media.",
