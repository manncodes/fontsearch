    "detailed_description": "This font, likely a sans-serif typeface, exhibits a strong, geometric construction with a clear emphasis on legibility. The letterforms are composed of simple, clean lines with minimal ornamentation, resulting in a bold and assertive visual presence. The consistent stroke weight and tight letter spacing contribute to a sense of unity and order, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a typeface that is both authoritative and approachable. Its bold weight and clear forms make it highly effective for large-scale displays, particularly in protest signage and digital activism, where its strong visual impact and clear message are paramount. The font's straightforward design and lack of embellishment evoke a sense of directness and urgency, aligning with the powerful message it conveys. It embodies a sense of collective action and solidarity, resonating with the contemporary social movements it has become associated with.",
