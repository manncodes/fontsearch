    "detailed_description": "This font's stark geometric construction is immediately apparent, with each character built from precise, rectilinear shapes. The consistent stroke weight and sharp corners create a sense of rigidity and order, reminiscent of early digital interfaces or architectural blueprints. However, the font's personality is softened by subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slightly rounded terminals on lowercase letters like 'a' and 'c'. These small details inject a touch of humanity into the otherwise austere design, making it feel less cold and more approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its clean lines and bold presence make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and technical documentation, while its subtle warmth allows it to be used in more human-centric contexts like website design or user interfaces. The font evokes a sense of modernism and efficiency, suggesting a future where technology and human experience are seamlessly integrated.",
