    "detailed_description": "Hinwil is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and sharp angles of the letterforms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, particularly at smaller sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail gives Hinwil a distinctive character, making it feel both modern and timeless. Its versatility shines in digital applications, where its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for user interfaces, web design, and mobile experiences. However, its classic proportions and subtle details also make it suitable for print, particularly for editorial design and branding projects that require a clean and sophisticated aesthetic. Hinwil's overall impression is one of clarity, confidence, and a touch of understated elegance, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects.",
