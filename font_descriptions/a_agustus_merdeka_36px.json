    "detailed_description": "Augustus Merdeka is a display typeface that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes, uneven weights, and exaggerated letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's construction is based on a loose, gestural approach, with each letterform feeling like a unique brushstroke. This results in a highly expressive typeface that conveys a sense of personality and individuality. The font's bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its rough, unfinished aesthetic evokes a sense of rebellion and nonconformity, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to stand out from the crowd. However, its irregular nature can make it challenging to read in extended text, limiting its use in body copy or smaller sizes.",
