    "detailed_description": "This font, with its jagged edges and irregular forms, embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. The letterforms are constructed with a distinct lack of symmetry, featuring sharp angles, uneven strokes, and a sense of deliberate imperfection. This deliberate distortion creates a sense of energy and movement, reminiscent of graffiti or street art. The font's bold, assertive character is further emphasized by its generous x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. While the font's unconventional design might not be suitable for formal settings, it excels in conveying a sense of rebellion, youthfulness, and urban grit. Its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that seek to capture a rebellious spirit or a sense of underground culture.",
