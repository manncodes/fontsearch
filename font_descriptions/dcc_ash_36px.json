    "detailed_description": "DCC Ash is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines, particularly in the uppercase characters. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and inviting. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. The distressed texture adds a layer of grit and authenticity, suggesting a connection to industrial design and urban aesthetics. This texture, while adding visual interest, also contributes to the font's overall sense of authenticity and approachability, making it feel less sterile and more human.",
