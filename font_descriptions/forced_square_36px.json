    "detailed_description": "Forced Square is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, minimalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise squares and rectangles, resulting in a highly structured and disciplined appearance. The letterforms are devoid of any curves or serifs, creating a clean and uncluttered visual impact. The font's bold weight and consistent stroke width contribute to its strong presence and assertive character. While the overall design is undeniably modern, it also carries a subtle retro feel, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. This duality makes it suitable for a range of applications, from contemporary branding and digital interfaces to retro-inspired projects and playful graphic designs. The font's bold and assertive nature makes it ideal for headlines, titles, and short text blocks, while its clean and legible design ensures readability even at smaller sizes. However, its minimalist aesthetic might not be suitable for lengthy text blocks or applications requiring a more nuanced or delicate touch.",
