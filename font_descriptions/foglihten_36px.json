    "detailed_description": "Foglihten is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a balanced approach to contemporary design. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke weights, provides a sense of order and clarity. However, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', inject a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination of geometric precision and humanist nuance creates a font that feels both modern and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. The overall character of Foglihten is confident yet approachable, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and trustworthy. Its clean lines and balanced proportions evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while the subtle humanist details add a touch of personality and warmth. Foglihten's versatility makes it a strong choice for a variety of projects, from corporate branding to editorial design. Its contemporary aesthetic and strong legibility make it well-suited for digital applications, while its balanced proportions and subtle details ensure that it remains elegant and refined in print.",
