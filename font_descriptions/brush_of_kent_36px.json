    "detailed_description": "Brush of Kent is a bold and expressive script font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, calligraphic strokes and dynamic letterforms evoke the immediacy of brushwork, creating a sense of authenticity and personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The uneven baseline and varying stroke weights add to its handcrafted charm, while the playful swashes and flourishes inject a touch of whimsy. This combination of technical precision and artistic freedom makes Brush of Kent a versatile choice for projects that require a unique and engaging visual identity. Its casual yet confident character makes it ideal for branding, packaging, editorial design, and digital interfaces, particularly those seeking a touch of vintage charm or a modern, hand-crafted aesthetic.",
