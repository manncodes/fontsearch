    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in the consistent, almost mechanical construction of its letterforms. The strokes are crisp and clean, with sharp terminals and minimal variation in thickness. This creates a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early 20th-century sans-serif designs. However, the font avoids being overly rigid by incorporating subtle humanist details, such as the slight curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', which add a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is a font that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying a sense of professionalism and sophistication without being overly formal. Its high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and bold presence suggest a sense of confidence and authority, while its subtle humanist touches create a welcoming and approachable feel. This balance makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual identity without sacrificing readability or accessibility.",
