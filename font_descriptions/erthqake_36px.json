    "detailed_description": "Earthquake is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letters are constructed with clean, precise lines and sharp corners, giving the font a strong, confident presence. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth is further emphasized by the font's generous x-height and open counters, which contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall effect is a font that is both visually striking and easy to read, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's bold, confident character evokes a sense of strength and stability, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. This combination makes it ideal for projects that require a balance of authority and approachability, such as corporate branding, technology companies, or educational materials.",
