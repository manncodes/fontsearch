    "detailed_description": "This font, constructed entirely from angular strokes and geometric shapes, evokes a sense of raw, unrefined energy. The letterforms are built from a limited set of basic shapes, primarily triangles and squares, creating a stark and minimalist aesthetic. The sharp angles and uneven stroke weights contribute to a sense of urgency and immediacy, while the overall structure maintains a surprising degree of legibility. The font's rough, hand-drawn quality suggests a sense of authenticity and DIY spirit, reminiscent of street art or graffiti. This raw energy makes it ideal for projects that demand a bold and unconventional visual language, such as edgy branding, street wear designs, or digital art projects. However, its limited character set and lack of stylistic variations might limit its use in longer-form text or more formal applications.",
