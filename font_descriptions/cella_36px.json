    "detailed_description": "F25 is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance makes F25 versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and screen. Its clean lines and contemporary aesthetic evoke a sense of professionalism and modernity, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of approachability and warmth. F25's versatility and balanced design make it a strong choice for projects that require a modern, yet approachable aesthetic.",
