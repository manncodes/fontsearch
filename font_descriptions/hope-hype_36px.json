    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, outlined letterforms, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric construction of the characters, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The double outline, a defining feature, adds a layer of depth and dimension, suggesting a sense of movement and energy. This combination of geometric structure and dynamic outline creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and engaging. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold presence and retro-inspired design evoke a sense of nostalgia for the futuristic visions of the past, while its clean lines and sharp angles suggest a modern, digital sensibility. This duality makes it ideal for projects that seek to blend classic design elements with contemporary aesthetics, particularly in the realm of technology, gaming, and branding.",
