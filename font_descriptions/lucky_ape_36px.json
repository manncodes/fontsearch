    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters built upon precise, almost mechanical, construction. The letterforms are characterized by their consistent width, sharp corners, and minimal curves. This creates a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early digital interfaces or even the precision of architectural drawings. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. While the overall impression is one of starkness and efficiency, the font avoids feeling cold or overly sterile. Subtle variations in stroke weight and the occasional rounded terminal add a touch of humanity, preventing the design from becoming overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle warmth makes it adaptable to a wide range of applications, from technical documentation and user interfaces to branding and editorial design. The font's clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of innovation and progress, aligning it with contemporary design trends that prioritize clarity and functionality.",
