    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, chunky letterforms and heavily distressed edges, embodies a raw, rebellious energy. The characters are constructed with a clear, almost geometric base, but then heavily modified with jagged, irregular edges and rough textures. This creates a visual tension between the underlying structure and the chaotic, almost destructive treatment. The high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even in small sizes, while the exaggerated weight and bold strokes give it a commanding presence. This font is not for the faint of heart; it demands attention and speaks to a sense of defiance and individuality. It's perfect for projects that need to convey a sense of grit, rebellion, or a raw, unpolished aesthetic. Think punk rock posters, street art murals, or edgy fashion brands. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to underground subcultures and the DIY spirit, evoking a sense of rebellion and nonconformity.",
