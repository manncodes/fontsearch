    "detailed_description": "Burning Wrath is a display typeface that embodies a dramatic, almost theatrical, sense of gothic horror. Its construction is based on sharp, angular strokes with exaggerated serifs that resemble jagged edges or flames. The letterforms are highly stylized, with pronounced ascenders and descenders that create a sense of verticality and intensity. The overall effect is one of dramatic contrast and visual impact, making it ideal for grabbing attention and conveying a sense of danger or mystery. While the font's design is rooted in traditional gothic styles, it has a contemporary edge, with a slightly distorted and almost digital feel. This makes it suitable for a range of applications, from horror movie posters and album covers to edgy fashion branding and website design. The font's bold and dramatic nature can be used to create a sense of excitement and intrigue, while its gothic aesthetic adds a touch of darkness and mystery.",
