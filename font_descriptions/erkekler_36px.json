    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and sharp, angular terminals, exudes a strong, futuristic aesthetic. The letters are built from a series of interlocking, angled planes, creating a sense of depth and solidity. This construction, reminiscent of early computer graphics and 80s sci-fi design, lends the font a distinctly retro-futuristic feel. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's bold, assertive character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of technological advancement and innovation, making it a perfect choice for projects related to science fiction, gaming, or futuristic technology.",
