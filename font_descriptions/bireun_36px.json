    "detailed_description": "Bireun is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, slightly rounded corners of its letterforms, creating a sense of order and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. While the overall structure is geometric, Bireun avoids feeling overly rigid through the introduction of subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Bireun a friendly and approachable personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and modern feel make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, while its subtle warmth allows it to be used effectively in contexts that require a touch of approachability. Bireun's contemporary design evokes a sense of simplicity and clarity, reflecting the values of modern digital culture.",
