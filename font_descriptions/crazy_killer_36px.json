    "detailed_description": "This font, reminiscent of hastily scribbled notes, embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. Each letterform is constructed with a series of overlapping strokes, creating a sense of immediacy and spontaneity. The irregular line weights and inconsistent letter spacing further enhance this raw, almost chaotic feel. While lacking the precision of traditional typography, the font's imperfections contribute to its unique character. The bold, expressive strokes evoke a sense of urgency and rebellion, making it suitable for projects that demand a gritty, edgy aesthetic. Its unconventional nature makes it ideal for capturing the energy of street art, punk rock, or underground culture. However, its lack of legibility at smaller sizes limits its practical applications, making it best suited for large-scale displays or bold headlines.",
