    "detailed_description": "Alto Voltage is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle curves gives Alto Voltage a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of innovation and progress, aligning it with modern design trends. Its versatility allows it to seamlessly integrate into both minimalist and more expressive designs, adding a touch of sophistication without overshadowing the content.",
