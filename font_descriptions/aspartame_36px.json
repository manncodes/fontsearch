    "detailed_description": "Aspartame is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, almost blocky letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its bold presence and good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall proportions are balanced, with a consistent weight and a slight condensed feel. The unique feature of Aspartame is its use of eroded terminals, giving the letters a slightly unfinished, almost pixelated look. This adds a playful and slightly quirky element to the font's personality. While the geometric construction suggests a sense of order and precision, the eroded terminals inject a touch of imperfection and human touch. This balance makes Aspartame suitable for a variety of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and playful designs. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of computer graphics and video games, while its bold and confident character suggests a modern, forward-thinking approach.",
