    "detailed_description": "Gribouille is a playful and expressive display typeface that combines a bold, chunky aesthetic with a hand-drawn, almost scribbly quality. The letters are constructed with a mix of geometric and organic forms, resulting in a unique visual character. The rounded terminals and slightly uneven strokes contribute to the font's casual and approachable feel, while the bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility even at large sizes. Gribouille's design evokes a sense of spontaneity and energy, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold and playful personality is desired. Its hand-drawn quality adds a touch of warmth and authenticity, while its bold weight and clear forms ensure readability even in demanding contexts. The font's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of projects, from children's books to branding for creative agencies.",
