    "detailed_description": "Ceria Lebaran is a display typeface that blends geometric construction with calligraphic flourishes, resulting in a unique visual language that is both bold and playful. The font's uppercase letters are characterized by their strong, angular forms, with sharp terminals and pronounced serifs that create a sense of dynamism and energy. The lowercase letters, on the other hand, are more rounded and fluid, adding a touch of whimsy and approachability to the overall design. This contrast between the uppercase and lowercase forms creates a visual tension that keeps the font engaging and interesting. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from headlines and logos to posters and packaging. The overall character of Ceria Lebaran is one of celebration and joy, with a hint of mystery and intrigue. Its bold forms and playful flourishes evoke a sense of festivity and excitement, while its unique design language suggests a connection to traditional Arabic calligraphy. This combination of boldness and whimsy makes Ceria Lebaran a versatile font that can be used to create a wide range of visual effects, from playful and whimsical to bold and dramatic.",
