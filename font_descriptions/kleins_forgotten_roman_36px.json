    "detailed_description": "Kleins Forgotten Roman is a serif typeface that blends classic Roman letterforms with a subtle touch of contemporary refinement. Its construction is rooted in traditional geometric principles, evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles of the serifs. However, the font avoids a purely rigid aesthetic, incorporating slightly rounded terminals and a touch of humanist warmth in the letterforms. This balance creates a typeface that is both legible and inviting, suitable for a range of applications from editorial design to branding. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, while its moderate weight and neutral character make it adaptable to various contexts. The overall impression is one of understated elegance, suggesting a timeless quality that transcends trends. The font's subtle playfulness, evident in the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves of the lowercase letters, adds a touch of personality without sacrificing professionalism. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of sophistication and approachability.",
