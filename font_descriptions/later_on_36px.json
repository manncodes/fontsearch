    "detailed_description": "Later On is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a contemporary, yet approachable aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a high x-height and open counters that contribute to its excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The subtle rounding of terminals, particularly in lowercase letters, adds a touch of warmth and softens the overall geometric feel. This balance between structure and approachability makes Later On versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. Its clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of clarity and efficiency, while the subtle humanization prevents it from feeling overly sterile. Later On's design suggests a forward-thinking approach, aligning with contemporary trends in digital design and communication.",
