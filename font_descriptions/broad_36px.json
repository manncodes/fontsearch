    "detailed_description": "Broad is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a bold, almost blocky appearance. Its construction is based on simple, clean lines and sharp angles, creating a strong and assertive presence. The letters are designed with a consistent stroke weight, resulting in a uniform and balanced visual impact. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Broad is confident and modern, with a hint of retro influence. Its bold lines and geometric forms evoke a sense of strength and stability, while the clean execution and sharp angles suggest a contemporary edge. Broad's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and signage. Its strong visual presence and clear legibility make it an effective choice for conveying authority and clarity. The font's geometric construction and bold forms also lend themselves to a sense of futuristic or technological association, making it a suitable choice for projects related to innovation and progress.",
