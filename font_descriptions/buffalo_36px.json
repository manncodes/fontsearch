    "detailed_description": "Buffalo is a script typeface that blends a classic calligraphic aesthetic with a contemporary sensibility. Its flowing strokes and graceful curves evoke the elegance of traditional penmanship, while its clean lines and consistent weight suggest a modern digital origin. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The subtle variations in stroke thickness and the gentle curves of the letterforms create a sense of warmth and approachability, making it ideal for branding, packaging, and editorial design. Buffalo's versatility allows it to seamlessly transition from elegant invitations to playful social media graphics, adding a touch of sophistication and personality to any project.",
