    "detailed_description": "Belle Epoque is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the early 20th century. Its clean lines and strong, consistent stroke weights create a sense of clarity and confidence. The font's distinctive features include its high x-height, which enhances legibility, and its open counters, which contribute to its airy and modern feel. The rounded terminals add a touch of warmth and approachability, balancing the font's geometric structure. The overall effect is a font that is both striking and approachable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold presence evokes a sense of vintage charm, reminiscent of Art Deco posters and early advertising, while its clean lines and modern proportions make it feel fresh and contemporary. Belle Epoque is a versatile font that can be used to create a range of moods, from playful and energetic to sophisticated and elegant.",
