    "detailed_description": "Candlestick is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet bold aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the multi-layered construction, where each letterform is composed of three parallel lines, creating a striking visual depth. This layering, combined with the geometrically-driven letterforms, results in a strong, almost architectural presence. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the geometric rigidity, adding a touch of approachability and making it less imposing. This balance between boldness and approachability makes Candlestick ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact without feeling overly aggressive. Its retro-futuristic vibe, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics, adds a layer of nostalgia and a sense of playful experimentation. Candlestick's versatility extends beyond traditional print applications, making it well-suited for digital interfaces, particularly in web design and mobile apps, where its bold presence and clear legibility translate effectively across various screen sizes.",
