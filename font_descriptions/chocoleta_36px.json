    "detailed_description": "Chocoleta is a playful script font that captures the energy of hand-lettering with a digital edge. Its brush-stroke construction is evident in the uneven line weights and expressive letterforms, creating a sense of spontaneity and personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the overall impression. This balance between organic and controlled elements makes Chocoleta suitable for a range of applications, from casual branding and social media graphics to more formal titles and headings. Its inherent energy and playful nature evoke a sense of youthful optimism and creativity, making it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of personality and a connection to contemporary digital culture.",
