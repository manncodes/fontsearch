    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its radical simplicity, built entirely from squares. Each letterform is constructed with a consistent stroke weight and sharp corners, creating a stark and geometric aesthetic. The lack of serifs or embellishments emphasizes the font's minimalist nature, lending it a sense of clarity and directness. While the square construction might seem rigid, the font's proportions are carefully balanced, ensuring readability even in small sizes. The consistent spacing between letters and words contributes to its clean and uncluttered appearance, making it ideal for digital interfaces and contemporary design projects. The font's starkness evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, suggesting a digital-native design aesthetic. It's a font that speaks to the contemporary need for clarity and direct communication, while also possessing a timeless quality that transcends trends.",
