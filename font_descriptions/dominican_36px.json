    "detailed_description": "Dominican is a display typeface that blends classic serif construction with a contemporary edge. Its strong, geometric forms are reminiscent of early 20th-century typefaces, but the subtle curves and rounded terminals soften the overall impression. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines and branding elements. The font's bold weight and confident stance lend it a sense of authority, while the subtle curves and playful details add a touch of approachability. Dominican's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from traditional print media to modern digital interfaces. Its strong visual presence and distinct personality make it a compelling choice for projects that require a touch of vintage charm with a modern twist.",
