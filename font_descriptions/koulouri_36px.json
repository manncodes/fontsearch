    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong, geometric construction with a distinct vintage feel. The letterforms are bold and confident, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a touch of formality and a sense of retro-inspired design. The overall impression is one of strength and reliability, reminiscent of classic signage and branding from the mid-20th century. The font's bold weight and clear forms make it ideal for headlines, logos, and display applications, where it can command attention and convey a sense of authority. Its vintage aesthetic adds a layer of nostalgia and authenticity, making it suitable for projects that seek to evoke a sense of history or tradition.",
