    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and striking display typeface that draws inspiration from both geometric and hand-drawn aesthetics. Its construction is primarily geometric, with sharp angles and clean lines, giving it a sense of structure and order. However, the execution is intentionally rough and uneven, adding a layer of human touch and imperfection. This contrast between the geometric foundation and the hand-drawn execution creates a unique visual tension, making the font feel both modern and organic. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, while the bold strokes and dramatic serifs add a sense of impact and presence. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, with a hint of playfulness and irreverence. It evokes a sense of energy and dynamism, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual statement is desired. While its rough execution might limit its use in body text, it excels in large-scale applications, particularly in digital environments where its bold presence and unique character can stand out.",
