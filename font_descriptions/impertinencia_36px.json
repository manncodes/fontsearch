    "detailed_description": "Impertinencia is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its construction is based on a geometric framework, evident in the clean lines and consistent proportions of the letterforms. The overall structure is quite rigid, with sharp corners and a lack of curves, giving it a modern and almost robotic feel. However, the font's personality is softened by subtle details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the slight variation in stroke thickness, which add a touch of humanity and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Impertinencia versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines to clean interfaces. Its bold and confident nature makes it suitable for projects that require a strong visual presence, while its subtle playfulness adds a touch of personality and approachability. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of contemporary design, with its clean lines and geometric structure reflecting the minimalist trends of modern digital culture. It suggests a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, making it a suitable choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of modernity and progress.",
