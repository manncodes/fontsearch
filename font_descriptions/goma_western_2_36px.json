    "detailed_description": "Boma Western 2 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1960s and 70s. Its construction is characterized by strong, rounded corners and a consistent, almost mechanical, application of curves. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro charm. The font's bold weight and geometric construction lend it a sense of authority and strength, while the rounded corners and slightly playful curves add a touch of approachability. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and optimism, while its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for modern applications. The font's bold personality and versatility make it a strong choice for projects that require a confident and engaging visual identity.",
