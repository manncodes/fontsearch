    "detailed_description": "Gorenq is a bold, expressive script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its flowing strokes and dynamic curves create a sense of movement and spontaneity, reminiscent of brush calligraphy. The font's irregular baseline and varying letter widths contribute to its natural, hand-drawn aesthetic. While the overall impression is casual and playful, the font's strong, confident strokes lend it a sense of authority. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and short text blocks. Gorenq's playful personality and dynamic character make it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality, such as branding for creative businesses, event posters, or social media graphics. Its bold, expressive nature evokes a sense of fun and energy, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to capture attention and create a memorable impression.",
