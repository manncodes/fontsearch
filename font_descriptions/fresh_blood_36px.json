    "detailed_description": "Fresh Blood is a display typeface that embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a series of jagged, irregular strokes, creating a sense of immediacy and urgency. The letterforms are highly stylized, with sharp angles and dramatic curves, giving the font a distinct, almost chaotic character. The unevenness of the strokes and the exaggerated proportions contribute to its raw, hand-drawn feel. While the font's legibility is somewhat compromised by its extreme styling, it excels in conveying a sense of rebellion and unconventionality. Its bold, aggressive nature makes it ideal for grabbing attention in headlines, posters, and other graphic applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's cultural associations lean towards street art, punk rock, and underground culture, evoking a sense of rebellion and nonconformity. It's a font that speaks to a younger generation, one that embraces individuality and challenges the status quo.",
