    "detailed_description": "Darkstone is a display typeface that draws inspiration from medieval blackletter styles, but with a contemporary twist. Its bold strokes and sharp angles create a strong visual presence, while the flowing flourishes and decorative elements add a touch of elegance. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a font that is both powerful and refined, suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While rooted in historical traditions, Darkstone's clean lines and modern proportions make it feel fresh and relevant for contemporary design. Its bold character and decorative flourishes evoke a sense of mystery and intrigue, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of drama or sophistication.",
