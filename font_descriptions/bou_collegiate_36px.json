    "detailed_description": "Bou Collegiate is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic collegiate lettering styles, but with a contemporary edge. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean, angular forms of the letters, particularly in the uppercase. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall geometric feel. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives the font a confident yet friendly personality. Bou Collegiate is well-suited for headlines, branding, and display applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold presence and retro-inspired aesthetic evoke a sense of nostalgia and tradition, while its clean lines and contemporary proportions make it feel fresh and relevant. The font's versatility allows it to be used across a range of media, from print to digital, and its bold character makes it ideal for capturing attention and conveying a sense of authority.",
