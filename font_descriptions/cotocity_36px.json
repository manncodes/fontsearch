    "detailed_description": "ColoCity is a display typeface that embodies a playful, retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its bold, geometric forms are reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics and early computer interfaces, yet its rounded terminals and subtle curves inject a touch of approachability. The font's construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, consistent appearance. The letters are designed with a strong emphasis on verticality, creating a sense of dynamism and energy. The bold weight and generous x-height ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. ColoCity's unique character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a bold, attention-grabbing presence. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia and playful experimentation, making it perfect for projects that aim to capture a sense of fun and energy.",
