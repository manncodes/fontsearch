    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, double-lined construction, evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and 80s arcade games. The geometric construction, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of precision and order, while the slight variations in letterform proportions add a touch of humanism. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The font's bold character and retro aesthetic make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as branding for tech companies, gaming titles, or retro-inspired designs. It can also be used for headlines, posters, and other display applications where its bold presence and nostalgic feel can be leveraged.",
