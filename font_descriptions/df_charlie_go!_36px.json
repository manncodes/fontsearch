    "detailed_description": "This font, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, is characterized by its bold, irregular strokes and a distinct lack of uniformity. Each letterform is unique, with varying thicknesses and angles, creating a raw, expressive feel. The overall impression is one of immediacy and energy, as if the letters were hastily scribbled down with a marker. This raw aesthetic is further emphasized by the use of rough, jagged edges and uneven spacing, adding to the sense of spontaneity and authenticity. While the font's lack of precision might make it challenging for extended reading, its bold character and energetic vibe make it ideal for grabbing attention in short bursts, such as headlines, logos, or social media graphics. The font's raw, unpolished aesthetic evokes a sense of rebellion and individuality, aligning with contemporary trends in design that embrace imperfection and authenticity.",
