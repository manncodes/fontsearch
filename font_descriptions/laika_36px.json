    "detailed_description": "Laika is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and sharp angles, giving it a sense of precision and modernity. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall geometric aesthetic. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Laika versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital displays. Its strong, confident character evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of mid-century science fiction and the early days of space exploration. Laika's bold presence and clear legibility make it ideal for capturing attention and conveying a sense of authority, while its playful, slightly rounded details add a touch of personality and approachability.",
