    "detailed_description": "A.Asian Hiro is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with a touch of humanist warmth. Its distinctive feature is the use of sharp, angular terminals, which give it a modern, almost futuristic feel. The letterforms are generally compact, with a moderate x-height and open counters that contribute to good legibility. The overall design is balanced and consistent, with a strong sense of rhythm and flow. While the angularity suggests a sense of dynamism and energy, the font also possesses a certain level of approachability due to the subtle curves in some letterforms, particularly in the lowercase. This balance makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from bold headlines to clean interfaces. A.Asian Hiro evokes a sense of contemporary design, perhaps referencing the sleek aesthetics of technology and urban environments. It carries a subtle hint of retrofuturism, suggesting a vision of the future as seen through the lens of the past.",
