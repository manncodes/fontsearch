    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and strong, almost brutalist forms, exudes a sense of power and authority. The sharp, angular terminals and the consistent, almost mechanical, stroke widths create a sense of precision and control. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The overall character is assertive and confident, with a hint of industrial grit, reminiscent of vintage signage and bold graphic design from the mid-20th century. This font would be a powerful choice for branding, headlines, and other applications where a strong, impactful visual is desired. Its bold, no-nonsense aesthetic suggests a brand that is confident, reliable, and unafraid to stand out.",
