    "detailed_description": "Jose is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, particularly in characters like 'H' and 'N'. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters, especially noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'e', introduce a sense of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a typeface that feels both contemporary and timeless. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Its clean lines and neutral personality make it a versatile choice for both corporate branding and personal projects, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold.",
