    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and graphic representation of knives, each glyph a unique silhouette. The design is highly stylized, with sharp angles and exaggerated proportions, creating a sense of danger and intensity. The font's construction is primarily based on geometric shapes, with each knife blade forming a distinct and recognizable form. The overall effect is one of raw power and aggression, with a strong visual impact. While the font's technical execution is simple, its bold and graphic nature makes it highly effective for conveying a sense of danger or rebellion. The font's cultural associations are complex, drawing on imagery of violence and rebellion, but also on the historical and cultural significance of knives as tools and weapons. It's a font that can be used to create a sense of urgency, danger, or even humor, depending on the context.",
