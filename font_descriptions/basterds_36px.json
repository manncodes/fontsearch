    "detailed_description": "Bastards is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that exudes a playful yet confident personality. Its construction is based on simple, almost brutal, geometric shapes, with sharp corners and a strong, consistent stroke weight. The letters are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between them, creating a sense of density and energy. This density is further emphasized by the high x-height and open counters, which ensure strong legibility even at small sizes. The overall effect is a font that is both visually striking and highly functional. While its geometric construction evokes a sense of order and precision, the slightly rounded terminals and playful glyph variations, such as the ampersand and the exclamation point, add a touch of whimsy and personality. This balance between structure and playfulness makes Bastards suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to playful illustrations and digital interfaces. Its bold, confident character makes it ideal for conveying a sense of energy, innovation, and irreverence, while its strong legibility ensures that it can be used effectively in a variety of contexts.",
