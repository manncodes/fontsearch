    "detailed_description": "Copystruct is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both legible and approachable. The letters are built upon a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines, particularly in the uppercase characters. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase letters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of warmth and personality. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness creates a font that feels both modern and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. The font's overall character is confident yet friendly, suggesting a brand that is both professional and approachable. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of efficiency and clarity, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of warmth and personality. Copystruct's versatility makes it a strong choice for a variety of projects, from corporate communications and web design to editorial layouts and signage.",
