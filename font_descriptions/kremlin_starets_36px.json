    "detailed_description": "Kremlin Starets is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct historical flavor. Its construction is rooted in classic geometric sans-serif principles, with a strong emphasis on clean lines and precise angles. The letterforms are highly structured, with a consistent stroke weight and minimal variation in width. This creates a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist design. However, the typeface also incorporates subtle humanist details, such as slightly rounded terminals and a touch of curvature in certain letterforms. These details soften the starkness of the geometric structure, adding a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying authority and sophistication while remaining accessible and engaging. Its bold weight and strong legibility make it suitable for large-scale applications, such as headlines, signage, and branding, where it can command attention and create a powerful visual impact. However, its subtle humanist touches also make it suitable for smaller sizes, where it can provide a clear and readable text experience. The typeface's historical references evoke a sense of tradition and heritage, while its contemporary design language ensures its relevance in modern design contexts. It is a versatile typeface that can be used to create a wide range of visual identities, from classic and elegant to bold and contemporary.",
