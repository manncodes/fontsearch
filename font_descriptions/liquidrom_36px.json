    "detailed_description": "Liquidrom is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct double-outline construction. This creates a bold, graphic presence, reminiscent of 1970s and 80s design trends. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with consistent stroke weights and a high x-height that ensures legibility even at small sizes. The rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Liquidrom versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and signage. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, making it ideal for projects that seek to convey a modern yet nostalgic feel.",
