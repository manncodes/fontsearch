    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms and consistent stroke weights, exudes a sense of confident clarity. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions soften the starkness of the geometric construction, lending a touch of approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The font's overall character is both modern and timeless, evoking a sense of efficiency and precision without feeling overly sterile. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. The font's clean lines and bold presence suggest a sense of authority and trustworthiness, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it relatable and engaging.",
