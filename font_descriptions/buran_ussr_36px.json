    "detailed_description": "Buran USSR is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct slant, reminiscent of both futuristic sci-fi aesthetics and the graphic design of the Soviet era. Its construction is based on strong, angular forms with a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of power and dynamism. The slanted angle, while adding a touch of playfulness, also contributes to a sense of speed and movement, further enhancing the futuristic feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall character of Buran USSR is bold and confident, yet with a touch of playful energy, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence with a hint of retro-futuristic charm. Its cultural associations with the Soviet space program and the era's graphic design style lend it a unique historical context, while its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to evoke a sense of futuristic optimism and technological advancement.",
