    "detailed_description": "Limetart is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, giving it a crisp and contemporary feel. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing it from feeling overly sterile. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Limetart's overall character is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a balance of professionalism and approachability. It evokes a sense of modernism without being overly trendy, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a clean and timeless aesthetic. Its cultural associations lean towards digital-native design and contemporary branding, while its historical influences can be traced back to the geometric sans-serif fonts of the early 20th century.",
