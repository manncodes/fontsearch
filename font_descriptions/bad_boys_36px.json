    "detailed_description": "Bad Boys is a contemporary take on the classic Gothic typeface, blending sharp geometric forms with subtle humanist details. The font's construction is based on a strong vertical axis, with tall, narrow letterforms and pronounced serifs. The ascenders and descenders are extended, creating a sense of grandeur and formality. The overall impression is one of confident strength and bold presence, yet the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly aggressive. This balance between classic Gothic structure and modern design sensibilities makes Bad Boys suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it effective for both large and small sizes, while its contemporary edge keeps it relevant in a digital landscape.",
