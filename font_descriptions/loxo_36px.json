    "detailed_description": "Loxo is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise aesthetic. The letters are composed of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a strong and assertive presence. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke weights further enhance readability. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves are introduced in the terminals of some letters, adding a touch of humanity and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives Loxo a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold and confident personality makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its clean and modern aesthetic lends itself to contemporary design trends. Loxo's strong visual impact and clear legibility make it a versatile choice for projects that require a strong and assertive presence.",
