    "detailed_description": "Factory LJDS is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a balanced approach to legibility and personality. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke weights, provides a strong foundation for clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, introduce a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This subtle humanist touch is further emphasized by the carefully balanced proportions, particularly in the lowercase letters, which maintain a sense of openness and flow. The font's overall character is one of confident simplicity, suggesting both professionalism and approachability. It draws inspiration from classic sans-serif designs, but with a contemporary sensibility that makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its excellent legibility at various sizes, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and small-scale text.",
