    "detailed_description": "Crooked is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and playful irregularity. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the font's defining characteristic is its deliberate distortion, with letters leaning and shifting in unexpected ways. This creates a dynamic and energetic feel, adding a touch of whimsy to its otherwise structured form. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text, particularly in digital environments. Crooked's unique personality makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of irreverence and a modern aesthetic, evoking a sense of playful experimentation and a connection to contemporary digital culture.",
