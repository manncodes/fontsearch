    "detailed_description": "Covid-SY is a display typeface that embraces a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated distortion applied to each letterform, creating a sense of movement and energy. This distortion is achieved through a combination of rounded corners, uneven stroke widths, and a slight wobble in the overall structure. While the font's construction is not strictly geometric, it maintains a sense of balance through its consistent use of rounded forms and its overall symmetrical structure. The high x-height and open counters contribute to its legibility, even with the distortion, making it suitable for headlines and short bursts of text. The font's playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a sense of fun and energy, such as children's books, branding for playful products, or social media graphics. However, its exaggerated distortion might not be suitable for large blocks of text or formal applications. The overall impression is one of lightheartedness and whimsy, evoking a sense of childhood nostalgia and a playful approach to design.",
