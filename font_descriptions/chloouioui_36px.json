    "detailed_description": "ChloeOuiOui is a playful script font that blends a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a touch of geometric precision. The lowercase letters are characterized by rounded forms and open counters, creating a sense of openness and approachability. The ascenders and descenders are carefully balanced, ensuring legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is lighthearted and friendly, with a hint of whimsy. It evokes a sense of handwritten notes and personal messages, suggesting a connection to the analog world. However, the font's clean lines and consistent stroke weights also lend it a modern feel, making it suitable for digital applications. ChloeOuiOui is particularly effective for branding, social media graphics, and website design, where its friendly personality and versatility can enhance visual communication.",
