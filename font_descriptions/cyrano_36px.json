    "detailed_description": "Cyrano is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, bold presence. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, precise letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility, while the open counters and consistent stroke widths ensure clarity even at small sizes. The overall design evokes a sense of confidence and authority, reminiscent of mid-century modernism with its clean lines and geometric precision. However, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Cyrano's bold character makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. Its clean lines and geometric structure also lend themselves well to digital interfaces, especially for mobile applications where legibility is paramount. The font's cultural associations range from the futuristic optimism of the 1960s to the contemporary aesthetic of minimalist design, making it a versatile choice for projects seeking a timeless yet modern feel.",
