    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct geometric construction, evident in the precise angles and consistent proportions of its letterforms. The stems are uniformly thick, creating a bold presence, while the open counters and generous x-height ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of clarity and precision, suggesting a modern, digital aesthetic. The font's sharp terminals and minimal serifs contribute to its clean, uncluttered appearance, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its bold weight and geometric structure lend a sense of authority and confidence, while the open counters and slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing it from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance makes it ideal for branding, headlines, and interfaces where a strong visual presence is desired without sacrificing readability.",
