    "detailed_description": "Almonte is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and sharp angles, reminiscent of mid-century modern design. The letterforms are highly legible, with a generous x-height and open counters that ensure readability even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Almonte a unique personality, making it both modern and timeless. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, while its legibility ensures it can also be used effectively for body text in digital interfaces. The font's cultural associations range from the futuristic optimism of the 1960s to the contemporary aesthetic of minimalist design, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a bold, confident, and visually striking typeface.",
