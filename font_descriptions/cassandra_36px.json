    "detailed_description": "Cassandra is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro aesthetic. Its construction relies on a combination of geometric shapes and precise, almost mechanical, lines. The letters are built from a series of horizontal and vertical stripes, creating a unique visual texture that evokes the graphic design of the 1960s and 70s. This striped pattern adds a layer of visual interest and depth, while maintaining a strong sense of clarity and legibility. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its readability, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a font that is both visually striking and functional, making it suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines to playful branding. Cassandra's strong geometric forms and retro vibe evoke a sense of confidence and optimism, reminiscent of a time of technological advancement and cultural change. It suggests a playful yet sophisticated approach to design, making it ideal for projects that seek to capture a sense of vintage charm with a modern twist.",
