    "detailed_description": "Cheap Fire is a display typeface that draws inspiration from both classic serif designs and the visual language of flames. Its bold strokes and dramatic serifs, reminiscent of a burning inferno, create a sense of energy and intensity. The font's construction is based on a strong geometric framework, with sharp angles and precise curves, giving it a sense of order and control. However, the flame-like serifs, which extend beyond the baseline and ascender, add a touch of chaos and unpredictability. This interplay between structure and dynamism creates a unique visual tension that makes the font both eye-catching and memorable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. Its bold and dramatic character makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as posters, album covers, and branding for edgy or rebellious brands. The font's association with fire evokes feelings of passion, power, and danger, making it a powerful tool for conveying a range of emotions.",
