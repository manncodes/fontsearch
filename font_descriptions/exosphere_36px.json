    "detailed_description": "Exosphere PX is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a futuristic aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, rectangular shapes with slightly rounded corners, creating a balance between geometric precision and visual warmth. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The bold weight and strong stroke contrast contribute to its assertive and confident character. Exosphere PX evokes a sense of technological advancement and futuristic design, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. Its bold and confident personality makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts that require a strong visual presence and a touch of retrofuturism.",
