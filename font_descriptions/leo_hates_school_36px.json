    "detailed_description": "The font \"Leo Hates School\" embodies a playful, almost rebellious spirit through its hand-drawn aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by a distinct lack of uniformity, with each character exhibiting unique quirks and inconsistencies. This deliberate irregularity creates a sense of spontaneity and authenticity, reminiscent of a child's handwriting. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall impression is one of youthful energy and a touch of irreverence, making it ideal for projects that require a casual, approachable tone. Its hand-drawn nature evokes a sense of personal expression and individuality, aligning it with contemporary trends in digital design that prioritize authenticity and human connection.",
