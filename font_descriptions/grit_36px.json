    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a raw, expressive energy, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes and uneven weights create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The bold, confident forms suggest a playful personality, while the slightly messy details add a touch of human imperfection. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and short-form text. Its informal character makes it ideal for projects that require a personal touch, such as branding for creative businesses, social media graphics, or quirky posters. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to contemporary street art and DIY aesthetics, evoking a sense of individuality and creative freedom.",
