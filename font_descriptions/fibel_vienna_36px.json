    "detailed_description": "Fibel Vienna presents a clean, contemporary sans-serif typeface with a subtle humanist touch. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, particularly in the uppercase letters. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a sense of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a versatile typeface suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of personality and warmth. Fibel Vienna's versatility and contemporary feel make it a strong choice for branding, editorial design, and user interfaces, particularly in contexts that require a balance of clarity and approachability.",
