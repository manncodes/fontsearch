    "detailed_description": "Echelon exhibits a classic serif construction with a contemporary twist. Its letterforms are based on a geometric framework, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines. The serifs are subtly bracketed, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric structure. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall weight is medium, striking a balance between boldness and refinement. This combination of classic structure and modern refinement gives Echelon a timeless elegance, suitable for both traditional and digital applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for body text, while its subtle sophistication elevates it for headlines and branding elements. The font's versatility allows it to seamlessly transition from print to screen, maintaining its visual integrity across various media.",
