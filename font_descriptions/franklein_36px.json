    "detailed_description": "Frank-Klein is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, creates a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism is further emphasized by the font's high x-height, which contributes to its legibility and makes it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The overall character of Frank-Klein is confident and professional, yet approachable and inviting. It draws inspiration from the modernist design principles of the mid-20th century, but its clean lines and versatility make it feel distinctly contemporary. This makes it a suitable choice for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying information clearly and effectively, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality.",
