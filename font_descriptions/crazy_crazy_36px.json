    "detailed_description": "Crazy Crazy (36px) is a playful yet legible sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its bold, confident strokes are balanced by slightly rounded terminals, creating a friendly and approachable feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The overall character of the typeface is energetic and optimistic, reminiscent of mid-century design trends. Its playful nature makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces where a touch of personality is desired. However, its strong legibility and versatility also make it suitable for more formal applications, such as corporate communications or signage.",
