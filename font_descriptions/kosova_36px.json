    "detailed_description": "Kosova is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost futuristic feel. Its construction is based on precise curves and angles, creating a clean and modern aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by their rounded corners and open counters, which contribute to a sense of openness and accessibility. The font's high x-height and consistent stroke weight ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. This makes it suitable for both digital and print applications, particularly in headlines, branding, and user interfaces. Kosova's bold and confident personality evokes a sense of innovation and progress, making it a fitting choice for projects that aim to convey a forward-thinking and technologically advanced image. Its clean lines and geometric structure also suggest a sense of order and efficiency, making it suitable for projects that require a sense of professionalism and clarity.",
