    "detailed_description": "Egotism is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on sharp, angular shapes with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The letterforms are designed with a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of uniformity and solidity. The font's distinctive feature is its bold, almost exaggerated, use of negative space, particularly in the lowercase letters. This creates a sense of openness and dynamism, while also contributing to its strong legibility. The overall character of Egotism is confident and assertive, with a hint of playfulness. It evokes a sense of energy and movement, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or futuristic sci-fi designs. This makes it particularly well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its bold nature and limited character set might make it less suitable for extended body text or more delicate design projects.",
