    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its radical simplicity, built entirely from squares. Each letterform is constructed with a consistent stroke weight and sharp corners, creating a stark and geometric aesthetic. The uniformity of the squares lends a sense of order and precision, while the lack of curves or embellishments contributes to a clean and uncluttered feel. This starkness is further emphasized by the absence of any serifs or decorative elements, resulting in a font that is both minimalist and highly legible. The font's bold and assertive nature makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its simplicity and clarity also make it effective for signage and wayfinding applications, ensuring readability even at a distance. The font's starkness evokes a sense of modernity and technological advancement, suggesting a connection to the digital world and the precision of code. It also carries a hint of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and the minimalist design aesthetic of the 1960s.",
