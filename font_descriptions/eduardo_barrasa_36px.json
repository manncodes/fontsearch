    "detailed_description": "Eduardo Barrasa is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, angular forms and a distinct lack of curves. Each letter is constructed from a series of sharp, precisely aligned lines, creating a stark and minimalist aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, while the consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to its clean and modern feel. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of futuristic edge. This makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's geometric construction and bold presence evoke a sense of order and precision, suggesting a technological or scientific context. However, the sharp angles and minimalist design also carry a hint of cyberpunk influence, hinting at a world of advanced technology and urban grit.",
