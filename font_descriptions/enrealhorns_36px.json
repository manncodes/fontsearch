    "detailed_description": "Enrealhorns is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp angles and angular forms, creating a strong, assertive presence. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal negative space, contributing to a sense of density and power. The font's distinctive feature is its use of sharp, jagged terminals, which add a sense of aggression and dynamism. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves are introduced in some letters, such as the 'o' and 'a', adding a touch of humanity and preventing the font from becoming overly rigid. The font's bold weight and assertive character make it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its angularity and sharp edges evoke a sense of power and authority, making it ideal for projects that require a bold and confident statement. However, its aggressive nature might not be suitable for all contexts, particularly those requiring a more approachable or delicate feel.",
