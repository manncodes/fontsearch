    "detailed_description": "Jesa Script is a bold and playful display typeface that blends a retro-inspired aesthetic with contemporary digital sensibilities. Its rounded, geometric forms are reminiscent of 1970s and 80s graphic design, but its clean lines and consistent stroke weights lend it a modern edge. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while its generous letter spacing creates a sense of openness and airiness. The playful curves and rounded terminals add a touch of whimsy, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other attention-grabbing applications. While its retro roots evoke a sense of nostalgia and fun, Jesa Script's clean execution and digital-friendly design make it equally suitable for contemporary branding and web design projects.",
