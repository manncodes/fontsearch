    "detailed_description": "Darb is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its flowing strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its friendly and approachable character. While the overall construction is loose and organic, Darb maintains a degree of legibility through its consistent stroke weight and clear letterforms. This balance makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from casual social media posts to more formal branding elements, as long as the context allows for a touch of whimsy. The font's casual yet legible nature evokes a sense of personal connection, suggesting a handwritten note or a heartfelt message. It's a font that feels both familiar and unique, capturing the essence of human expression in its digital form.",
