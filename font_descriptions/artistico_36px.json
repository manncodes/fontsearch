    "detailed_description": "Artistico is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet gritty aesthetic. Its bold, chunky letterforms are reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, with a distinct texture that suggests a rough, almost distressed surface. The letters are constructed with a combination of geometric and organic elements, resulting in a unique visual balance. The rounded corners and open counters contribute to a sense of approachability, while the uneven stroke weights and textured surfaces add a touch of rebellious energy. This combination of playful and edgy elements makes Artistico suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to edgy branding and street-inspired designs. Its bold presence and distinct personality make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of fun, energy, and individuality.",
