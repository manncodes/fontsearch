    "detailed_description": "Bobardi is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are composed of simple, geometric shapes, with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The terminals are often squared off, adding to the font's bold and assertive character. The overall effect is one of precision and clarity, reminiscent of early digital displays and graphic design trends from the 1970s and 80s. This retro-futuristic vibe is further enhanced by the font's bold weight and generous x-height, which contribute to its strong presence and legibility. Bobardi's bold, geometric nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. It can also be used effectively in digital interfaces, particularly those with a retro or futuristic theme. However, its bold weight and geometric construction may limit its use in extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
