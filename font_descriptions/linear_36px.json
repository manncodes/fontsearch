    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its construction: each letterform is built from a series of parallel lines, creating a distinct geometric structure. This approach results in a bold, almost architectural presence, reminiscent of early digital typography or even the pixelated graphics of retro video games. The lines are slightly offset, adding a subtle sense of depth and texture, while the consistent stroke weight throughout the alphabet maintains a sense of uniformity. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. However, the stark geometric nature might limit its use in longer blocks of text, where a more organic typeface might be preferable. The overall impression is one of playful experimentation, a nod to the early days of digital design, yet with a contemporary edge that feels both nostalgic and forward-looking.",
