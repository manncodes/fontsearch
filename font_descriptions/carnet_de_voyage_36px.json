    "detailed_description": "Carnet de Voyage is a playful display font that combines a bold, cartoonish aesthetic with a surprisingly legible structure. Its defining feature is the double outline, which creates a sense of depth and dimension, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering. The outlines are not perfectly parallel, adding a touch of hand-crafted imperfection that contributes to the font's friendly and approachable personality. While the overall form is rounded and slightly exaggerated, the letterforms maintain a clear, geometric foundation, ensuring readability even at larger sizes. This balance between playful and functional makes Carnet de Voyage suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful illustrations and children's books. The font's bold, cartoonish style evokes a sense of fun and whimsy, reminiscent of classic comic book lettering or vintage children's illustrations. It suggests a playful and lighthearted tone, making it ideal for projects that aim to engage and entertain.",
