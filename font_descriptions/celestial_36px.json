    "detailed_description": "Celestial C36px is a font built entirely from circles and lines, creating a distinctive, almost pixelated aesthetic. The geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent spacing, giving the font a clean, modern feel. The use of circles for terminals and internal details adds a playful touch, softening the otherwise rigid structure. This combination of geometric precision and playful details results in a font that is both visually striking and surprisingly legible, especially at larger sizes. While the font's construction suggests a digital origin, its clean lines and simple forms also evoke a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer graphics or even mid-century science fiction. This duality makes it suitable for a range of applications, from playful branding and website design to more serious projects like tech-focused publications or futuristic interfaces.",
