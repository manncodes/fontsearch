    "detailed_description": "IDM Minimal is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, minimalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms with sharp corners and consistent stroke weights. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of clean, modern simplicity, with a touch of retrofuturistic charm. This font's bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of order and efficiency, making it suitable for applications that require a clear, impactful visual language. Its minimalist design also lends itself well to digital interfaces, where its sharp edges and clean lines translate seamlessly to screen displays. While its starkness might seem austere at first glance, IDM Minimal possesses a subtle playfulness in its unexpected letterforms, such as the rounded 'a' and the unique 'g'. This touch of whimsy adds a layer of personality to the font, preventing it from feeling overly rigid or cold.",
