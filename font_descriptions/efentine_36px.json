    "detailed_description": "Efentime is a playful and expressive font that utilizes a bold, extruded outline to create a sense of depth and dimension. The rounded letterforms, particularly in the lowercase, contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, while the consistent stroke weight and open counters ensure good legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's playful nature is further emphasized by the inclusion of a variety of decorative characters, including symbols and punctuation marks that add a touch of whimsy. This combination of technical precision and playful design makes Efentime suitable for a wide range of applications, from children's books and branding to website headers and social media graphics. Its bold and expressive nature evokes a sense of fun and energy, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and visual impact.",
