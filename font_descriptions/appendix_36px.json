    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a classic serif structure with a contemporary twist. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean, precise lines and consistent proportions, particularly in the uppercase letters. The serifs, however, are subtly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability that softens the otherwise rigid geometry. This balance between structure and softness creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and inviting. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The overall character is confident and refined, suggesting a sense of professionalism and sophistication. While rooted in traditional typography, the font's subtle modern touches make it feel relevant for contemporary design projects. Its versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps.",
