    "detailed_description": "DubTone is a bold, sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, vertical strokes and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's overall structure is based on a grid system, resulting in a balanced and harmonious appearance. The weight of the typeface is bold, giving it a confident and assertive presence. The design is reminiscent of mid-century modern typography, with its clean lines and geometric forms, but it also has a contemporary feel thanks to its digital-native aesthetic. DubTone is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, where its bold presence and clear legibility make it stand out. It can also be used for body text in smaller sizes, but its bold weight may not be ideal for extended reading.",
