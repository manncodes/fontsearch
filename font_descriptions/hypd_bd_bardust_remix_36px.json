    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction, evokes a sense of retrofuturism. Each letterform is built from sharp angles and interlocking shapes, creating a distinct, almost mechanical aesthetic. The consistent use of negative space within the letters, particularly in the lowercase 'a' and 'e', adds to the sense of structure and precision. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the terminals of some letters, like the 'r' and 'g', introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements makes the font feel both modern and nostalgic, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. The font's bold weight and strong contrast make it highly legible, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired.",
