    "detailed_description": "Assurant Standard is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp angles, strong verticality, and a consistent stroke weight throughout. The letters are designed with a clear emphasis on legibility, featuring open counters and a high x-height that ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a slight futuristic edge that evokes a sense of speed and dynamism. Its historical influences are evident in its geometric construction, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist typefaces, while its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of energy and innovation. The font's bold and angular forms lend themselves well to headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic makes it particularly suitable for projects that seek to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the past while simultaneously looking towards the future. The font's bold and confident character, combined with its strong legibility, makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.",
