    "detailed_description": "En Garde is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classical and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise aesthetic. The letterforms are composed of sharp angles and straight lines, creating a sense of order and structure. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of En Garde is bold and confident, with a touch of playfulness. The sharp angles and geometric construction evoke a sense of modernity and sophistication, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. En Garde's bold and confident personality makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence, while its clean and modern aesthetic ensures that it remains relevant in today's digital landscape. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the modernist movement, with its emphasis on geometric forms and clean lines. However, its playful elements also suggest a contemporary sensibility, making it a versatile choice for projects that bridge the gap between tradition and innovation.",
