    "detailed_description": "Alita Brush 36px embodies the spirit of hand-drawn lettering, capturing the expressive energy of a brush stroke. Its construction is characterized by fluid, organic curves and angled strokes, creating a dynamic and visually engaging typeface. The varying stroke weights and deliberate imperfections add a sense of authenticity and personality, reminiscent of traditional brush calligraphy. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its playful and informal character makes it ideal for branding projects that seek a casual and approachable aesthetic, particularly in the realm of digital media, where its hand-crafted feel resonates with contemporary design trends. The font's inherent dynamism and expressive nature make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of energy, creativity, and authenticity.",
