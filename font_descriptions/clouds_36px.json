    "detailed_description": "Clouds is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent stroke widths. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are often blunt and squared, adding to the overall digital feel. While the design is undeniably modern, it also carries a retro charm, reminiscent of early computer graphics and video game aesthetics. This duality makes Clouds suitable for a range of applications, from digital interfaces and branding to retro-inspired designs and playful typography. Its bold, confident character evokes a sense of technological advancement and playful experimentation, making it a fitting choice for projects that embrace a digital-native aesthetic.",
