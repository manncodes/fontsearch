    "detailed_description": "Dear Studio Audience is a playful script font that combines a classic calligraphic feel with a contemporary, almost cartoonish edge. The letters are drawn with a distinct, slightly exaggerated stroke that gives them a sense of movement and energy. The generous curves and rounded terminals contribute to a friendly and approachable aesthetic, while the subtle slant adds a touch of dynamism. The font's overall construction is loose and organic, with a focus on visual flow rather than strict geometric precision. This makes it well-suited for informal applications like branding, social media graphics, and handwritten-style typography. The font's playful nature and clear legibility make it ideal for headlines, logos, and short text blocks, adding a touch of personality and whimsy to any design project. While its casual vibe might not be appropriate for formal documents, it excels in creating a friendly and engaging atmosphere, particularly in digital contexts.",
