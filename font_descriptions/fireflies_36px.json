    "detailed_description": "Fireflies is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct angularity. Its construction is based on sharp, precise lines and angles, creating a strong, modern aesthetic. The letterforms are tightly spaced, with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are often cut at sharp angles, adding to the font's assertive character. This combination of geometric precision and bold strokes gives Fireflies a confident, almost futuristic feel, reminiscent of early digital interfaces and cyberpunk aesthetics. Its strong visual presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital displays, particularly in contexts where a sense of energy and dynamism is desired. However, its angularity might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
