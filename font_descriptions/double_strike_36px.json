    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its double-stroke construction, creating a bold, graphic presence. Each letterform is composed of two parallel lines, subtly offset from each other, resulting in a unique visual texture. The slight slant of the strokes adds a dynamic energy, while the rounded terminals soften the overall impression. This combination of boldness and approachability makes the font suitable for a range of applications, from playful headlines to more serious branding. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and warmth, suggesting a personal touch and a connection to the human element. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to communicate a sense of creativity, individuality, and approachability.",
