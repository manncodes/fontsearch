    "detailed_description": "Bunny Rabbits is a playful and whimsical display font constructed entirely from stylized bunny silhouettes. Each letterform is a unique composition of rabbits in various poses, creating a charming and unexpected visual experience. The font's irregular baseline and varying letter heights contribute to its playful nature, while the consistent use of black outlines ensures readability even at smaller sizes. The font's whimsical character makes it ideal for children's books, greeting cards, and festive branding, adding a touch of lightheartedness and charm to any project. However, its intricate design and irregular spacing may limit its use in large blocks of text or formal settings.",
