    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and precise proportions of its letterforms. The consistent stroke weight and minimal variation in thickness contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The overall structure is balanced and symmetrical, with a strong emphasis on verticality, creating a sense of order and clarity. The lowercase letters are particularly striking, with their unique shapes and unexpected angles, adding a touch of playfulness to the otherwise formal design. This combination of geometric precision and subtle whimsy makes the font suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility ensure readability even at small sizes, while its unique character adds a touch of personality to any project. The font evokes a sense of contemporary sophistication, suggesting a blend of classic design principles and modern sensibilities. It carries a subtle air of retrofuturism, hinting at a time when technology was both exciting and mysterious, yet grounded in a sense of order and functionality.",
