    "detailed_description": "A  bold and rugged display typeface, \"Abrasion\"  exudes a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its chunky,  distorted letterforms are reminiscent of  hand-carved wood type,  evoking a sense of  vintage craftsmanship. The  heavily distressed  appearance,  achieved through  roughened edges and  irregular outlines,  suggests a  worn-in,  timeless quality.  The  font's  strong,  vertical  orientation  and  wide  letterspacing  create a  powerful presence,  ideal for  attention-grabbing headlines and  bold branding.  While  its  distinctive  character  might  limit  its  readability  in  extended  text,  \"Abrasion\"  shines  in  short,  impactful  applications,  evoking  a  sense of  gritty authenticity and  uncompromising  strength.",
