    "detailed_description": "Certo Headline is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its construction is based on a bold, geometric structure, evident in the strong, angular strokes and consistent letterforms. The overall impression is one of a hand-drawn, almost scribbled aesthetic, achieved through the use of rough, textured outlines and subtle variations in stroke weight. This combination of geometric precision and hand-drawn informality creates a unique visual tension, making the font feel both playful and authoritative. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. The font's inherent energy and slightly chaotic nature make it ideal for projects that require a bold, attention-grabbing presence, particularly in the realm of streetwear, music, and youth culture. It evokes a sense of rebellious creativity and a playful disregard for convention, aligning with the spirit of contemporary subcultures.",
