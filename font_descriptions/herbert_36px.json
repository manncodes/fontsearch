The ascenders and descenders are extended, adding to the font's dynamic and expressive character. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, Herbert maintains a level of legibility through its clear letterforms and consistent baseline. The font's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from personal notes and social media posts to branding and packaging that seeks a friendly and approachable tone. Herbert's casual yet legible nature evokes a sense of warmth and familiarity, making it suitable for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level.
