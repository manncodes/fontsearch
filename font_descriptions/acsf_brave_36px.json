    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its precise construction and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of clean, sharp lines and angles, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance readability, making it suitable for extended blocks of text. While the overall aesthetic is undeniably modern, the font avoids feeling overly sterile or cold. Subtle curves in the terminals and a slight humanist touch in the letterforms add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and human-centered details gives the font a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used effectively for branding, editorial design, web interfaces, and even signage, conveying a sense of professionalism, modernity, and accessibility.",
