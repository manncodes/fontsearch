The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale display and smaller text sizes. The font's overall character is both modern and timeless, evoking a sense of efficiency and functionality. Its clean lines and bold forms suggest a connection to the world of technology and design, while its rounded edges soften the impact and create a sense of approachability. Subway's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and clear legibility make it ideal for headlines and titles, while its rounded forms and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes.
