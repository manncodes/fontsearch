    "detailed_description": "Doodles is a playful script font that captures the essence of handwritten notes. Its flowing strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying thicknesses of the strokes, the subtle curves, and the occasional flourishes. While the overall impression is casual, the font maintains a degree of legibility, thanks to its clear letterforms and consistent baseline. The inclusion of playful glyphs, such as a dog icon, further enhances its whimsical character. Doodles is well-suited for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of warmth, such as social media graphics, invitations, or handwritten notes. Its informal nature makes it ideal for conveying a friendly and approachable tone, while its legibility ensures that the message remains clear.",
