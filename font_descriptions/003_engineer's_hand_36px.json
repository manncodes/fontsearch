    "detailed_description": "Engineer's Hand is a display typeface that captures the immediacy and personality of handwritten lettering. Its irregular strokes and varying weights evoke the natural flow of a pen on paper, creating a sense of authenticity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at larger sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. The playful curves and angled terminals add a touch of whimsy, while the overall structure remains grounded and legible. This combination of hand-drawn charm and typographic clarity makes Engineer's Hand ideal for projects that require a personal touch, such as invitations, posters, and social media graphics. Its casual yet confident aesthetic aligns with contemporary trends in design, suggesting a sense of authenticity and human connection.",
