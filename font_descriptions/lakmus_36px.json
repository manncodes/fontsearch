    "detailed_description": "Lakmus is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and precise angles, giving it a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are highly condensed, with a wide x-height and open counters that contribute to its legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive and modern character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. Lakmus's bold weight and condensed form make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, making it suitable for projects that aim to convey a sense of innovation and progress. The font's bold and confident personality aligns well with brands that value clarity, efficiency, and a forward-thinking approach.",
