    "detailed_description": "This font's character is defined by its bold, angular strokes and a distinct lack of curves. The letterforms are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a geometric and almost mechanical aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to a sense of openness and legibility, while the tight letter spacing adds to the font's compact and energetic feel. The overall impression is one of raw energy and unrefined boldness, reminiscent of hand-painted signage or street art. This font's lack of traditional typographic refinement makes it particularly well-suited for projects that demand a strong visual impact and a sense of immediacy. It could be used effectively for headlines, posters, or branding that seeks to convey a sense of urban grit or rebellious spirit.",
