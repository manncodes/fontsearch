    "detailed_description": "Frail Sans embodies a contemporary sans-serif aesthetic with a subtle humanist touch. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean, unornamented forms, particularly in the uppercase letters. The consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to its legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Frail Sans a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and mobile applications. Its clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of efficiency and clarity, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of personality and approachability. This makes it a good choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability, such as technology companies, educational institutions, and creative agencies.",
