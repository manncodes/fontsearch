    "detailed_description": "Angular is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms, with each letterform built from a series of straight lines and right angles. This creates a strong, bold presence, reminiscent of early digital displays or retro video game graphics. The font's x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility even at small sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke weights further enhance readability, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. While its angularity might suggest a cold or harsh personality, the subtle rounding of some terminals and the overall balance of the letterforms create a sense of approachability. This makes Angular suitable for a wide range of projects, from tech-focused branding to playful editorial designs. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of digital technology, while its clean lines and strong presence feel modern and impactful.",
