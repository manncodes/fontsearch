    "detailed_description": "JD Persegi is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of playful humanity. Its construction is based on precise, almost pixelated, squares and rectangles, giving it a strong, modern feel. The letterforms are highly legible, with a consistent stroke weight and open counters that ensure clarity even at small sizes. The terminals, however, are slightly rounded, adding a subtle warmth and approachability that softens the otherwise rigid geometry. This balance between precision and softness creates a personality that is both confident and inviting. The font's historical influences are evident in its geometric structure, reminiscent of early 20th-century sans-serifs like Futura and Kabel. However, its pixelated quality and overall cleanness point to a contemporary digital aesthetic, making it well-suited for modern interfaces and branding. The font's cultural associations lean towards a sense of technological advancement and minimalist design, evoking a sense of efficiency and clarity. Its practical applications are diverse, ranging from website design and mobile apps to corporate branding and editorial layouts. Its strong legibility and clean lines make it ideal for both large-scale displays and small-scale text, while its playful touch adds a touch of personality to any project.",
