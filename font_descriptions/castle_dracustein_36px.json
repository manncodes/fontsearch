    "detailed_description": "Castle Dracustein is a display typeface that embodies a gothic horror aesthetic. Its exaggerated letterforms, sharp angles, and jagged edges create a sense of unease and intrigue. The font's construction is based on a combination of organic and geometric forms, resulting in a unique and unsettling visual language. The letterforms are heavily distorted, with elongated strokes and dramatic curves that evoke a sense of movement and tension. The overall effect is one of a font that is both playful and menacing, capable of adding a touch of darkness and whimsy to any design. The font's bold and dramatic nature makes it ideal for use in headlines, posters, and other large-scale applications. Its unique character and strong visual impact make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of mystery, suspense, and even a touch of humor. However, its highly stylized nature may limit its readability in smaller sizes or for extended text blocks.",
