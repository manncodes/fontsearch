    "detailed_description": "Lowercase letters in this font are constructed with a strong geometric foundation, featuring sharp angles and consistent stroke widths. The uppercase letters, however, exhibit a more humanist touch, with subtle curves and slight variations in stroke thickness. This contrast creates a dynamic tension, adding visual interest and a sense of personality. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall design is bold and confident, yet the subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly aggressive or cold. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. The font's strong geometric foundation evokes a sense of order and clarity, while the humanist touches add a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination suggests a modern, confident, and approachable brand identity, suitable for businesses that value both innovation and human connection.",
