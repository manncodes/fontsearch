    "detailed_description": "Barokah is a playful script font that captures the essence of casual handwritten typography. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and warmth, reminiscent of personal notes or informal signage. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. While the overall impression is relaxed and friendly, the font's consistent stroke weight and well-defined letterforms maintain a degree of professionalism, preventing it from appearing childish or overly whimsical. This balance makes Barokah a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of personality without sacrificing readability. Its informal yet polished aesthetic aligns well with contemporary design trends, particularly in branding, social media, and digital content where a sense of authenticity and human connection is valued.",
