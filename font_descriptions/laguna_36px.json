    "detailed_description": "Laguna is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and clean lines, evokes a sense of precision and order, reminiscent of mid-century modern design. The bold, almost blocky letterforms, combined with the subtle 3D effect, create a sense of depth and dimensionality, adding a touch of playful dynamism. This combination of geometric structure and subtle visual interest makes Laguna suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to digital interfaces and even retro-inspired game design. The font's strong visual presence and playful personality make it a compelling choice for projects that seek to convey a sense of confidence, innovation, and a touch of retro charm.",
