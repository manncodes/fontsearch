    "detailed_description": "Clegame is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and approachability. Clegame's overall character is both whimsical and confident, suggesting a sense of fun and creativity. It draws inspiration from classic calligraphic styles, but with a modern twist that feels fresh and contemporary. Clegame is well-suited for branding, packaging, and digital applications where a friendly and approachable tone is desired. Its casual yet sophisticated aesthetic makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and social media graphics. While its handwritten nature lends itself to informal contexts, its well-defined letterforms and consistent spacing ensure readability even in longer blocks of text.",
