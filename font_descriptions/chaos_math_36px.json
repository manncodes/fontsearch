    "detailed_description": "Chaos Math (sospx) is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letters are composed of simple, geometric shapes with sharp corners and minimal curves, creating a strong, confident presence. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and distinctive letterforms give it a powerful and assertive character, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. This combination of geometric precision and bold personality makes Chaos Math suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual impact and contemporary feel make it a compelling choice for projects that require a bold statement and a touch of retro-futuristic flair.",
