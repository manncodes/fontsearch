    "detailed_description": "Federico is a display typeface that embraces a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated 3D effect, achieved through thick outlines and a pronounced shadow. This creates a sense of depth and volume, making the letters appear to pop off the page. The construction is simple, with rounded corners and a consistent stroke weight, contributing to its friendly and approachable feel. While the overall design is whimsical, the careful attention to letterforms ensures legibility, making it suitable for headlines and short bursts of text. The font's bold and playful nature evokes a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of classic comic book lettering or vintage children's illustrations. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to add a touch of personality and whimsy to digital designs, particularly in branding and social media graphics.",
