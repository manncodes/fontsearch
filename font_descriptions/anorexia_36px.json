    "detailed_description": "Anorexia is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its distinctive, almost skeletal, letterforms. The font's construction is geometric, with sharp angles and a consistent stroke weight throughout. This creates a sense of starkness and minimalism, reminiscent of early digital typography. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated proportions and a distinct lack of curves. The 'A' and 'R' are particularly striking, with their sharp angles and open counters. The overall effect is one of boldness and assertiveness, yet with a touch of fragility due to the thinness of the strokes. This makes Anorexia suitable for headlines and branding where a strong visual impact is desired, but it may not be ideal for extended body text due to its lack of legibility at smaller sizes. The font's starkness and geometric nature evoke a sense of modernity and technological advancement, while its thinness and angularity suggest a certain vulnerability. This duality makes it a compelling choice for projects that aim to convey both strength and fragility, such as technology brands or artistic expressions.",
