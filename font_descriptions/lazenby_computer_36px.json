    "detailed_description": "Lazenby Computer is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies the spirit of early digital design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, rectangular shapes with minimal curves, creating a sense of clarity and efficiency. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is bold and confident, with a slightly industrial feel. It evokes the aesthetic of early computer interfaces and video games, reminiscent of the pixelated graphics and limited color palettes of that era. Lazenby Computer is well-suited for digital applications, particularly in user interfaces, website design, and branding for technology-focused companies. Its retro-futuristic vibe adds a touch of nostalgia and personality to contemporary projects, while its technical precision ensures readability across various screen sizes.",
