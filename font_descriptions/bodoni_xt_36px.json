    "detailed_description": "Bodoni XT is a contemporary take on the classic Bodoni style, balancing traditional elegance with a modern sensibility. Its geometric construction is evident in the sharp, angular strokes and the consistent, almost mechanical, proportions. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The subtle bracketed serifs, however, add a touch of warmth and humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Bodoni XT a confident yet approachable character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its classic roots lend it an air of sophistication and authority, while its modern execution ensures it feels fresh and relevant in contemporary design. The font's versatility allows it to be used for everything from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography, seamlessly transitioning between print and screen.",
