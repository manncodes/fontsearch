    "detailed_description": "Lino Chisel is a display typeface that embodies the rugged charm of hand-carved wood type. Its defining characteristic is the distinct chisel-like stroke endings, achieved through a deliberate, almost exaggerated, truncation of the letterforms. This technique creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity, reminiscent of vintage signage and handcrafted printing. The font's bold weight and generous x-height contribute to its strong presence, making it ideal for headlines and titles that demand attention. While the chisel cuts add a touch of roughness, the overall structure of the letters remains surprisingly legible, thanks to the clear counters and well-defined shapes. This balance between ruggedness and readability makes Lino Chisel suitable for a wide range of applications, from vintage-inspired branding to contemporary digital interfaces where a touch of handcrafted authenticity is desired. The font's inherent boldness and slightly aggressive nature evoke a sense of strength and confidence, making it a powerful choice for projects that require a statement-making presence.",
