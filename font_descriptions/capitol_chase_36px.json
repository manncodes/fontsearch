    "detailed_description": "Capitol Chase embodies the spirit of casual, expressive handwriting, capturing the spontaneity of a quick note or a personal message. Its irregular letterforms, with varying stroke weights and playful flourishes, create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. While the overall impression is relaxed and friendly, the font's confident strokes and consistent baseline suggest a sense of control and intentionality. This balance between informality and structure makes Capitol Chase ideal for projects that require a personal touch without sacrificing professionalism. Its cultural resonance lies in its connection to the handwritten aesthetic, evoking a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, while its contemporary relevance stems from its adaptability to digital platforms and its ability to convey a sense of personality and individuality.",
