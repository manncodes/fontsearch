    "detailed_description": "This font, with its jagged, almost spiky letterforms, is a bold statement of rebellious energy. The construction is highly organic, with each letter seemingly carved from a single stroke, creating a sense of raw, unrefined expression. The extreme angles and sharp terminals contribute to a feeling of aggression and intensity, while the uneven spacing and inconsistent stroke widths add to the chaotic aesthetic. This font is not for the faint of heart, but it packs a punch in its raw, unbridled energy. It's a font that screams for attention, demanding to be noticed and felt. While its legibility is limited, especially at smaller sizes, it excels in conveying a sense of danger, rebellion, and raw emotion. It's a font that speaks to the fringes, to those who embrace the unconventional and the untamed.",
