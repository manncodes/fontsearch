    "detailed_description": "Belladonna is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from Art Deco and mid-century design. Its construction is based on clean, angular lines and precise curves, creating a strong visual presence. The letters are built with a consistent stroke weight, resulting in a bold and confident appearance. The font's distinctive features include its high x-height, which enhances legibility, and its open counters, which contribute to its airy and modern feel. The rounded terminals add a touch of warmth and approachability, balancing the geometric rigor. Belladonna's bold character evokes a sense of sophistication and retro charm, making it suitable for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it effective for headlines, logos, and display applications. However, its geometric nature might limit its use in extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
