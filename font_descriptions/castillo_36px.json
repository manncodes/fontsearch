    "detailed_description": "Castillo (36px) is a bold blackletter typeface that draws inspiration from medieval gothic scripts, yet possesses a contemporary edge. Its sharp, angular strokes and pronounced serifs create a strong visual presence, reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts and historical documents. The font's tall x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The carefully balanced proportions and consistent stroke weights contribute to its overall sense of order and authority. While rooted in tradition, Castillo's clean lines and modern execution give it a distinct contemporary feel, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of historical elegance without sacrificing readability. Its bold character and strong visual impact make it ideal for branding, titles, and headlines, particularly in contexts that evoke a sense of history, tradition, or craftsmanship.",
