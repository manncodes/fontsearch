    "detailed_description": "Drugstore Waltz is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet gritty aesthetic. Its construction is based on a combination of geometric and organic forms, resulting in a unique visual language.

The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Drugstore Waltz is bold and confident, with a hint of rebelliousness. It evokes a sense of nostalgia for vintage signage and graphic design, while also feeling distinctly contemporary. Its rough edges and irregular forms suggest a DIY aesthetic, making it ideal for projects that embrace a sense of authenticity and imperfection. The font's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to editorial design and web graphics. Its bold and distinctive character makes it particularly well-suited for headlines, logos, and other visual elements that require a strong visual impact.",
