    "detailed_description": "AnnStone is a display typeface that blends the ornate flourishes of blackletter with the geometric precision of Art Deco. Each letterform is encased in a square frame, creating a sense of order and structure. The intricate details within the frames, however, are anything but rigid. Swirling vines, delicate tendrils, and stylized floral motifs add a touch of whimsy and elegance. The high x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the bold strokes and sharp terminals lend a sense of authority. This combination of contrasting elements creates a unique visual tension, making AnnStone both eye-catching and sophisticated. Its historical roots in medieval calligraphy and its contemporary Art Deco influences make it suitable for projects that require a touch of vintage charm with a modern edge. While its intricate details might limit its use in large blocks of text, AnnStone excels in headlines, logos, and decorative elements, adding a touch of refined elegance to any design.",
