    "detailed_description": "Lucitas is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The pixelated effect is achieved through the use of small, square-shaped glyphs, creating a retro-futuristic feel. This design choice evokes a sense of digital nostalgia, reminiscent of early video games and computer interfaces. Lucitas's bold character and playful personality make it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its pixelated nature adds a touch of whimsy and retro charm, making it ideal for projects that require a unique and memorable visual identity.",
