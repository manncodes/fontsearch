    "detailed_description": "Baston is a display typeface that blends a classic sans-serif structure with a distinctly distressed aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent stroke widths and sharp corners, provides a sense of order and clarity. However, the deliberate erosion effect, applied to every glyph, introduces a layer of visual texture and irregularity. This interplay between structure and imperfection creates a unique character, balancing a sense of vintage industrial design with a contemporary edge. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding elements. The distressed effect adds a touch of grit and authenticity, suggesting a sense of history and craftsmanship. This makes Baston particularly well-suited for projects that aim to evoke a sense of vintage industrial design, urban culture, or handcrafted authenticity. Its bold and distinctive personality makes it a powerful tool for creating visual impact and communicating a sense of ruggedness and authenticity.",
