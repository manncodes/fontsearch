    "detailed_description": "Font Hellas Dust 036px embodies a raw, hand-drawn aesthetic, capturing the immediacy of a rough sketch. Its construction relies on bold, angular strokes, often with uneven thickness, creating a sense of spontaneity and energy. The letterforms are highly stylized, with sharp terminals and open counters that contribute to a sense of dynamism. While the overall design is irregular, there's a deliberate consistency in the use of sharp angles and jagged edges, lending a sense of controlled chaos. This font evokes a sense of rebellion and unconventionality, reminiscent of street art or graffiti. Its rough texture and bold forms suggest a rebellious spirit, while its angularity and sharp edges convey a sense of urgency and power. The font's inherent roughness makes it ideal for projects that demand a bold, edgy aesthetic, such as punk rock posters, street wear branding, or edgy digital art. However, its legibility can be compromised at smaller sizes due to the intricate details and uneven stroke weights.",
