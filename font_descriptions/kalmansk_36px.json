    "detailed_description": "Kalmansk is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost futuristic feel. Its construction is based on precise angles and clean lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are bold and confident, with a high x-height that ensures strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the typeface's modern aesthetic. The overall effect is one of precision and efficiency, suggesting a digital-native design sensibility. While the geometric construction lends itself to a sense of formality, the slightly rounded corners of the lowercase letters and the generous spacing between characters create a sense of approachability and warmth. This balance makes Kalmansk suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and mobile apps. Its bold and confident character makes it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility and versatility make it suitable for body text as well. The typeface's futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of innovation and progress, making it a strong choice for brands and projects that want to convey a sense of modernity and dynamism.",
