    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Sketchy Times\", is a playful and informal take on the classic Times New Roman typeface. It features a distinct hand-drawn aesthetic, with each letter appearing as if it were sketched with a slightly shaky hand. The strokes are thin and uneven, giving the font a casual and slightly whimsical feel. The overall effect is one of authenticity and personality, as if the letters were drawn directly onto the page.",
