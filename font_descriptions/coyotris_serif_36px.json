    "detailed_description": "Coyotris Serif is a playful yet legible serif typeface that blends classic design principles with a contemporary, almost cartoonish charm. Its construction is rooted in geometric forms, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp angles of terminals. However, the font softens this geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves of the lowercase 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric structure and humanist warmth creates a unique personality that feels both familiar and fresh. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its playful nature makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and even children's books, while its legibility ensures it can be used effectively in larger blocks of text. Cayotris Serif evokes a sense of whimsy and optimism, reminiscent of vintage cartoons and playful graphic design. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to inject personality and charm into digital interfaces, while still maintaining a level of professionalism.",
