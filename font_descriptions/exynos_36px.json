    "detailed_description": "Exynos is a geometric sans-serif typeface built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and modern aesthetic. The letters are constructed with sharp angles and straight lines, creating a sense of precision and order. The font's distinctive feature is its double-stroke design, where each letterform is outlined with a second, slightly offset stroke. This creates a bold and impactful visual presence, while also adding a subtle layer of depth and dimension. The consistent stroke weight and tight letter spacing contribute to a sense of uniformity and balance, making it highly legible even at smaller sizes. Exynos's geometric construction and sharp angles evoke a sense of futuristic technology and digital innovation, making it suitable for contemporary branding, web design, and user interfaces. Its bold and confident character suggests a sense of authority and power, while its clean and modern aesthetic aligns with current trends in graphic design.",
