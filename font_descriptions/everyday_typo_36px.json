    "detailed_description": "Everyday Typo is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, particularly in the uppercase letters. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through the introduction of slightly rounded terminals and a touch of humanist influence in the lowercase forms. This balance creates a typeface that is both legible and approachable, suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's open counters and generous x-height ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. Its neutral character and lack of overt stylistic flourishes allow it to blend seamlessly into various contexts, from corporate branding to editorial layouts. Everyday Typo evokes a sense of contemporary simplicity, suggesting a clean and efficient approach to design, while its subtle warmth hints at a human touch, making it feel approachable and relatable.",
