    "detailed_description": "Fluent Sans exhibits a clean, modern aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a high x-height, contributing to its strong legibility. The rounded terminals and slightly open counters add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanist details creates a versatile typeface suitable for a wide range of applications. Its contemporary feel aligns well with digital interfaces and branding, while its clear readability makes it effective for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The font's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and accessibility, making it a suitable choice for projects that prioritize communication and user experience.",
