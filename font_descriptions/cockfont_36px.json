    "detailed_description": "Cockfont (36px) is a playful and whimsical display font that draws inspiration from classic cartoon lettering. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves create a sense of lightheartedness and fun, while the bold outlines and consistent stroke weight ensure strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive features include the exaggerated curves of the lowercase letters, the playful swashes on the uppercase letters, and the unique treatment of the numbers and punctuation marks. These elements contribute to the font's overall personality, which is both charming and energetic. Cockfont is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other display applications where a touch of whimsy is desired. Its playful nature makes it ideal for children's books, branding for creative businesses, and projects that require a lighthearted and engaging tone. However, its bold outlines and exaggerated curves may make it less suitable for body text or applications requiring a more formal or sophisticated aesthetic.",
