    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, double-lined construction, creating a striking visual impact. Each letterform is composed of two parallel lines, with subtle variations in their spacing and curvature. This technique results in a geometrically precise aesthetic, reminiscent of early digital typography or even retrofuturistic design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is one of confident clarity and playful energy, suggesting a sense of retro-inspired modernity. Its bold lines and geometric structure lend themselves well to headlines, logos, and digital interfaces, while its playful nature makes it suitable for branding, packaging, and even editorial design. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the early days of computer graphics and the rise of digital culture, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a time when technology was both exciting and somewhat primitive.",
