    "detailed_description": "Hexatus is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct, almost architectural character. Its construction is based on a series of interlocking squares and rectangles, creating a rigid, almost mechanical aesthetic. The sharp angles and heavy weight give it a commanding presence, while the consistent stroke width and open counters ensure good legibility even at small sizes. The font's overall character is assertive and confident, with a hint of retrofuturism. It evokes a sense of power and authority, reminiscent of industrial design and sci-fi aesthetics. Hexatus is well-suited for headlines, branding, and display applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold nature makes it ideal for large-scale signage, posters, and digital interfaces, while its geometric construction lends itself to graphic design elements and architectural applications. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the mid-century modern movement, with its clean lines and bold forms echoing the design principles of that era. It also has a contemporary appeal, reflecting the current trend towards geometric and minimalist design aesthetics.",
