    "detailed_description": "Helsinki is a bold sans-serif typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its rounded, geometric construction, reminiscent of early digital fonts, gives it a friendly and approachable feel. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the letterforms add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric structure and organic details makes Helsinki versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its playful nature evokes a sense of modern optimism and energy, while its clear and legible forms ensure readability across various media. Helsinki's design reflects a contemporary understanding of typography, where legibility and personality are equally important, making it a strong choice for projects that require a bold and engaging visual identity.",
