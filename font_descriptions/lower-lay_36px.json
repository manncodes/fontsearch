    "detailed_description": "Lower-Lay is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to geometric design principles. Its construction is characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a precise, almost architectural, approach to letterforms. The lowercase letters, particularly 'a', 'e', and 'o', exhibit a slight curvature in their terminals, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that feels both contemporary and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website copy to branding materials. Its clean lines and minimalist design evoke a sense of clarity and efficiency, aligning it with contemporary design trends that prioritize simplicity and functionality. Lower-Lay's versatility allows it to seamlessly integrate into both digital and print environments, making it a valuable tool for designers seeking a modern and adaptable typeface.",
