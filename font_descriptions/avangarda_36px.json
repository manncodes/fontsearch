    "detailed_description": "Avantgarde is a striking display typeface characterized by its bold, geometric construction and distinctive double-line stroke. The letters are built with sharp corners and precise angles, creating a sense of rigidity and formality. This geometric foundation is further emphasized by the consistent width of the strokes, which maintain their thickness throughout the letterforms. The double-line stroke, a defining feature of Avantgarde, adds a layer of visual interest and depth, enhancing the font's bold presence. While the overall impression is one of starkness and modernity, the subtle curves in letters like 'C' and 'S' introduce a touch of humanism, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or mechanical. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements contributes to Avantgarde's versatility, making it suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and logos to contemporary branding and editorial design. Its strong visual impact and distinctive character make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of authority, innovation, and modern sophistication.",
