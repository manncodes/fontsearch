    "detailed_description": "Esphimere is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a sleek, modern aesthetic with a touch of playful energy. Its construction is based on geometric principles, evident in the clean lines and consistent proportions of its letterforms. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanist details gives Esphimere a distinctive personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its contemporary feel and versatility make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts that require a clean, modern aesthetic with a hint of playful energy. The font's subtle slant adds a dynamic element, suggesting movement and forward momentum, while its overall lightness and openness evoke a sense of optimism and accessibility.",
