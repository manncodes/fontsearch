    "detailed_description": "A Annnyeong Haseyo (36px) by WeP is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct, almost futuristic feel. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms, with a strong emphasis on verticality. The letters are tightly spaced, creating a sense of density and power. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are often sharp and pointed, adding to the font's assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves are introduced in some letters, like the 'a' and 'o', adding a touch of humanity and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives the font a unique personality, making it suitable for a variety of applications. It could be used for headlines, branding, or even user interface elements, where its bold presence and clear legibility would be appreciated. The font's futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of innovation and progress, making it a good choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of modernity and technological advancement.",
