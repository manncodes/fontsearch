    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, angular forms and pronounced 3D effect, evokes a sense of retrofuturism. The geometric construction of the letters, with sharp corners and straight lines, creates a sense of precision and power. The exaggerated depth of the 3D effect, achieved through a series of parallel lines, adds a dynamic and almost kinetic quality to the typeface. The overall effect is one of confident energy and a futuristic aesthetic, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video games. The font's bold presence and strong legibility make it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a powerful and attention-grabbing visual is desired. However, its highly stylized nature might limit its use in extended text blocks, especially at smaller sizes.",
