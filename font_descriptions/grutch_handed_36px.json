    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Gutch Handed\", embodies a playful yet slightly rough aesthetic. Its construction is based on a hand-drawn style, evident in the inconsistent stroke widths and the deliberate imperfections in the letterforms. The overall character is casual and approachable, with a hint of rebelliousness. The font's irregular baseline and uneven spacing contribute to its hand-crafted feel, suggesting a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. While the font's technical limitations might make it less suitable for large blocks of text, its unique personality makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where a touch of personality is desired. The font's cultural associations lean towards contemporary digital culture, evoking the DIY aesthetic of online communities and the raw energy of street art. It's a font that speaks to a generation that values authenticity and individuality, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to connect with a younger audience.",
