    "detailed_description": "Ciudad Capital is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letters are composed of simple, rectangular shapes with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight, creating a strong, confident presence. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of Ciudad Capital is bold and assertive, yet approachable due to the subtle rounding of the terminals. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and headlines to digital interfaces and signage. Its geometric construction and bold presence evoke a sense of modernity and confidence, while the subtle rounding of the terminals adds a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a strong visual impact without feeling overly aggressive.",
