    "detailed_description": "Gidole is a sans-serif typeface that balances a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its clean lines and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. This combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Gidole versatile for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its contemporary feel evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, while its subtle curves and rounded corners prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold. Gidole's balanced design makes it suitable for both print and digital media, and its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays and signage.",
