    "detailed_description": "Kaori Gel presents a unique blend of geometric construction and subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Kaori Gel suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of optimism and innovation, making it a strong choice for projects that require a modern and engaging aesthetic.",
