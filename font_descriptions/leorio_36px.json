    "detailed_description": "Leorio is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost-circular shapes of the lowercase letters, particularly 'o' and 'a'. The terminals, while sharp, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability to the otherwise rigid structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that feels both professional and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The overall impression is one of clarity and confidence, making it ideal for branding, web design, and editorial applications. Leorio's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of digital-native design, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch. It's a versatile font that can be used to create a range of visual identities, from sleek and minimalist to friendly and approachable.",
