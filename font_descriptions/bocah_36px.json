    "detailed_description": "Bocah is a playful display font that embraces a hand-drawn aesthetic, evoking the charm of childhood scribbles. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves create a sense of whimsy and informality, while the bold strokes and consistent weight provide a sense of clarity and legibility. The font's irregular baseline and inconsistent letter spacing contribute to its hand-crafted feel, adding a touch of spontaneity and personality. While the overall design is casual and lighthearted, the font's bold weight and clear forms ensure readability even at larger sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and playful branding elements. The font's playful nature and nostalgic appeal make it ideal for projects targeting a younger audience or conveying a sense of fun and creativity.",
