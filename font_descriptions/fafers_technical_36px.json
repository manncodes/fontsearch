    "detailed_description": "Fafers Technical embodies a clean, functional aesthetic rooted in geometric construction. Its uppercase letters exhibit a strong, consistent stroke weight, with sharp terminals and minimal curves. The lowercase letters maintain this geometric precision, though with slightly more rounded terminals, adding a touch of approachability. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's design evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, reminiscent of technical drawings and industrial design. Its straightforward nature makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces and mobile apps to technical documentation and signage. The font's clean lines and modern feel align with contemporary design trends, suggesting a digital-native aesthetic while retaining a timeless quality.",
