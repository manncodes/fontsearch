    "detailed_description": "Arroose is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric designs. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and precise angles of the letterforms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Arroose a distinct personality, making it feel both contemporary and timeless. The font's versatility shines in its ability to adapt to various applications, from website headers and branding elements to editorial layouts and even digital interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for both large and small sizes, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold. Arroose's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, confidence, and modernity, making it a fitting choice for projects that require a clean, professional, and approachable aesthetic.",
