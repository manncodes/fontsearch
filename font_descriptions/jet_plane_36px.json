    "detailed_description": "Jet Plane is a bold, expressive script font that captures the energy of hand-lettering with a touch of vintage charm. Its flowing strokes and dramatic flourishes create a sense of movement and dynamism, while the uneven line weights and slightly irregular letterforms add a touch of authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is one of playful informality, suggesting a sense of creativity and spontaneity. While its calligraphic origins are evident, Jet Plane's contemporary feel makes it ideal for branding, packaging, and digital projects that require a touch of personality and visual impact.",
