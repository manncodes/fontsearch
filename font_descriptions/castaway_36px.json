    "detailed_description": "Castaway (36px) is a display typeface that blends classic serif construction with a playful, almost cartoonish personality. Its bold strokes and generous x-height create a strong visual presence, while the rounded terminals and exaggerated curves add a touch of whimsy. The font's overall structure is based on traditional serif principles, with clear distinctions between thick and thin strokes, but the execution is deliberately loose and informal, giving it a handcrafted feel. This combination of classic structure and playful execution makes Castaway suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful branding and retro-inspired designs. Its bold presence and whimsical character evoke a sense of fun and nostalgia, suggesting a connection to vintage graphics and playful branding. The font's strong legibility and versatility make it a good choice for both print and digital media, particularly in large sizes where its personality can shine.",
