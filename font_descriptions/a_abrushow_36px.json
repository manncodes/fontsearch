    "detailed_description": "Abrushow is a display typeface that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its construction is based on thick, uneven strokes with pronounced variations in weight, creating a dynamic and expressive feel. The letterforms are often asymmetrical, with sharp angles and jagged edges that add to the font's sense of immediacy and spontaneity. The overall character is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of urgency and excitement. The font's rough, unrefined aesthetic evokes a sense of street art and graffiti, suggesting a rebellious and unconventional spirit. While its legibility is best at larger sizes, Abrushow's unique character makes it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. It's a font that demands attention and speaks to a contemporary audience seeking authenticity and a touch of rebelliousness.",
