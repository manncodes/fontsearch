    "detailed_description": "Hage is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its letterforms are characterized by a strong vertical axis, with consistent stroke weights and a high x-height that contributes to its clear legibility. The rounded terminals and slightly bracketed serifs add a touch of warmth and approachability, softening the otherwise stark geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance gives Hage a distinctive personality, making it feel both modern and timeless. Its versatility allows it to be used effectively in a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Hage's clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it feel approachable and inviting. This combination of qualities makes it a compelling choice for projects that require a balance of clarity, elegance, and human connection.",
