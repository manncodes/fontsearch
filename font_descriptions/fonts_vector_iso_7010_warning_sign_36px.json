The symbols themselves are a mix of abstract and representational, ranging from easily recognizable icons like fire and radiation to more stylized depictions of hazards like electrical shock and falling objects. This combination of straightforward design and diverse imagery creates a sense of urgency and caution, making it suitable for a wide range of safety applications. The set's straightforwardness and universality make it easily understood across cultures and languages, reinforcing its effectiveness in conveying critical information.",
