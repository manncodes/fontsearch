    "detailed_description": "Calm PX is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet sophisticated aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the bold, three-dimensional extrusion applied to each letterform, creating a sense of depth and visual interest. The geometric construction of the letters, with sharp angles and clean lines, contributes to a modern and confident feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The subtle variations in stroke weight and the slight rounding of the terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Calm PX suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful branding and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and playful nature evoke a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics and futuristic sci-fi designs. This contemporary relevance makes it ideal for projects that seek to capture a sense of playful innovation and technological advancement.",
