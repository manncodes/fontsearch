    "detailed_description": "Amal is a geometric sans-serif typeface built on a grid system, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp corners, straight lines, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of precision and order. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is bold and confident, with a slight retro feel reminiscent of early digital interfaces. This combination of technical precision and playful retro vibes makes Amal suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital art. Its bold presence and clear readability make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other prominent visual elements, while its retro aesthetic adds a touch of personality and nostalgia. Amal's geometric construction and sharp corners evoke a sense of efficiency and modernity, while its playful nature suggests a connection to the digital world and its evolving culture.",
