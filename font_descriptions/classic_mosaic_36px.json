    "detailed_description": "Classic Mosaic is a decorative font built upon a grid-based structure, with each letterform composed of a series of small, repeating squares. This construction creates a distinct visual texture, reminiscent of mosaic tiles or pixelated imagery. The font's overall character is playful and eye-catching, with a strong sense of retro charm. It evokes a sense of vintage design, perhaps referencing early computer graphics or the playful aesthetic of 1980s video games. The font's bold, blocky forms and consistent spacing make it highly legible, even at smaller sizes. However, its intricate detail and decorative nature limit its practicality for extended text blocks. Classic Mosaic is best suited for headlines, logos, and short bursts of text where its unique visual impact can be fully appreciated. It adds a touch of whimsy and nostalgia to projects, suggesting a playful and approachable tone.",
