    "detailed_description": "Highlander is a bold, blackletter font that draws inspiration from medieval calligraphy, but with a contemporary edge. Its thick strokes and sharp angles create a strong, commanding presence, while the subtle curves and rounded terminals add a touch of humanity. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The distinctive features include the dramatic swashes on the lowercase 'f' and 'g', the angular 'A' and 'M', and the unique 'Q' with its extended tail. The overall effect is a font that is both powerful and approachable, capable of conveying authority and confidence without feeling overly aggressive. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and logos to headlines and display text. The font's historical roots in medieval script evoke a sense of tradition and craftsmanship, while its contemporary design language makes it feel fresh and relevant. It's a font that can be used to create a sense of history and heritage, while also conveying a sense of modernity and innovation.",
