    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a classic sans-serif construction with a contemporary twist. Its geometric foundation is evident in the clean, unornamented letterforms, particularly in the consistent width of strokes and the precise angles of the terminals. However, the subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of humanist warmth, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's clean execution and consistent weight distribution contribute to its professional demeanor, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its versatility allows it to seamlessly integrate into modern interfaces, corporate branding, and editorial layouts, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling cold or impersonal. The font's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey both professionalism and approachability, reflecting the current trend towards design that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",
