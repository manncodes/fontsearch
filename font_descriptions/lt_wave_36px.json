    "detailed_description": "LT Wave is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, rounded forms and a distinct wave-like curvature in its letterforms. This curvature, most pronounced in the lowercase 'a' and 'o', adds a playful and dynamic element to the otherwise rigid geometric structure. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall impression is one of confident modernity, with a touch of playful energy. Its bold weight and rounded forms evoke a sense of optimism and accessibility, while the geometric construction lends a sense of professionalism and clarity. LT Wave's contemporary aesthetic makes it well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts where a bold and energetic visual identity is desired.",
