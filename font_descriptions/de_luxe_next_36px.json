Its construction is characterized by clean, precise lines and open counters, creating a sense of clarity and legibility. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its readability even at smaller sizes.

The font's versatility is evident in its ability to adapt to a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for large-scale displays, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it equally effective for smaller text blocks.
