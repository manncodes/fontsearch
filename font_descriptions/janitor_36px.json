    "detailed_description": "Janitor is a playful yet legible script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its flowing strokes and uneven letterforms evoke the casualness of a quick note, while its clear counters and consistent baseline ensure readability. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying stroke weights and subtle calligraphic flourishes, adding a touch of personality to each character. While the overall impression is informal, the font's well-defined shapes and consistent letterforms prevent it from appearing sloppy. This balance makes it suitable for a range of applications, from casual social media posts to more formal branding elements, as long as the context allows for a touch of informality. Janitor's playful energy and approachable aesthetic evoke a sense of warmth and authenticity, making it ideal for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level.",
