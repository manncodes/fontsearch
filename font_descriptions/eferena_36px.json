    "detailed_description": "Eferena is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its bold presence and clear legibility, even at small sizes. The overall weight is heavy, with thick strokes and minimal negative space, creating a sense of solidity and impact. While the geometric structure evokes a sense of order and precision, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions add a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes Eferena suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and even retro-inspired designs. Its strong visual presence and clear legibility make it ideal for conveying a sense of authority, power, and confidence, while its subtle humanization prevents it from feeling overly aggressive or intimidating. Eferena's bold, geometric aesthetic evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video games, while its clean lines and sharp corners also suggest a modern, digital sensibility. This combination of retro and contemporary influences makes it a versatile choice for projects that seek to blend nostalgia with a forward-looking perspective.",
