    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and playful display typeface that draws inspiration from graffiti and street art. Its exaggerated letterforms, with their sharp angles and dramatic 3D extrusion, create a sense of energy and movement. The thick strokes and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes. The font's playful nature is further emphasized by the use of rounded terminals and the occasional playful distortion of letterforms. While its primary application is likely in headlines and branding, its bold personality could also be used for posters, packaging, and other eye-catching designs. The font's cultural associations with urban culture and street art make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of rebellion, creativity, and individuality.",
