    "detailed_description": "Mabella is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its strong verticality and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and legibility. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. Mabella's clean lines and contemporary aesthetic evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile. This balance makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and user interfaces, where it can convey a sense of modernity and approachability without sacrificing clarity.",
