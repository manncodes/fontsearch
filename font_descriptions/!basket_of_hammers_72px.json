    "detailed_description": "This font, \"Basket of Hammers\", is a bold and playful display typeface with a distinct hand-drawn aesthetic. Its chunky, irregular letterforms evoke a sense of energy and informality, as if they were created with a large brush or marker.

The font's design suggests a sense of movement and dynamism, making it suitable for projects that require a bold and attention-grabbing visual impact.",
