    "detailed_description": "Etobicoke is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a subtle touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric structure and humanist details gives Etobicoke a versatile personality, capable of conveying both professionalism and a sense of playful modernity. Its clean lines and bold presence make it ideal for branding, headlines, and digital interfaces, while its retro-inspired character adds a touch of nostalgia and personality to contemporary designs. Etobicoke's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects seeking a balance between modern sophistication and a hint of vintage charm.",
