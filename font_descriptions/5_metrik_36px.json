    "detailed_description": "5 metrik is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise, almost pixelated, squares and rectangles, resulting in a stark and uncluttered appearance. The font features a consistent stroke weight throughout, with sharp, angular terminals that contribute to its bold and assertive character. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. This combination of geometric precision and strong legibility makes 5 metrik ideal for digital interfaces, particularly in user interfaces and web design, where clarity and visual impact are paramount. The font's starkness and geometric nature evoke a sense of order and efficiency, aligning it with contemporary design trends that prioritize minimalism and functionality. It suggests a digital-native design language, reflecting the clean lines and precise forms found in modern technology.",
