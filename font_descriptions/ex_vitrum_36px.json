    "detailed_description": "Ex Vitrum embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a subtle humanist touch. Its construction relies on precise angles and straight lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a consistent stroke weight and open counters that enhance legibility. While the overall impression is modern and minimalist, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in certain characters, like the 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail makes Ex Vitrum versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying information clearly and concisely, while its subtle warmth and approachability prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold. Ex Vitrum evokes a sense of contemporary sophistication, suggesting a brand or project that is both innovative and approachable.",
