    "detailed_description": "Komika Boo is a playful, hand-drawn font that captures the energy of casual scribbles. Its irregular letterforms, with their exaggerated curves and angled strokes, create a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven baseline adds to its hand-drawn charm. This combination of legibility and personality makes Komika Boo suitable for a wide range of applications, from casual social media posts to playful branding projects. Its informal character evokes a sense of fun and accessibility, making it ideal for projects that aim to connect with a younger audience. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic also suggests a sense of authenticity and creativity, making it a good choice for projects that want to convey a personal touch.",
