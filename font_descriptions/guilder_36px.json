    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals create a sense of clarity and precision, while the slightly rounded corners and open counters add a touch of approachability. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, balanced with a hint of warmth. The font's design is reminiscent of mid-century sans-serif styles, but with a contemporary edge. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and modern aesthetic make it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of sophistication and a sense of accessibility.",
