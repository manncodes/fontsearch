    "detailed_description": "Aretha is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Aretha versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its high x-height and generous letter spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both print and screen. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a brand that is both modern and approachable, reliable yet innovative. Aretha's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of digital-native design, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch, making it a strong choice for brands seeking to communicate both professionalism and approachability.",
