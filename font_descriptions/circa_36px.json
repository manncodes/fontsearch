    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric simplicity, built entirely from arcs and curves. Each letterform is a distinct shape, constructed with a clear focus on visual impact. The consistent use of rounded corners and open counters creates a sense of openness and accessibility, while the bold weight and strong contrast between black and white deliver a powerful presence. The font's playful nature is evident in the unique shapes of letters like 'Q' and 'X', which add a touch of whimsy to the overall design. While the font's geometric foundation lends itself to clean, modern applications, its playful character makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality. The font's bold, graphic nature evokes a sense of retro futurism, reminiscent of 1960s and 1970s design trends, while its clean lines and simple forms feel distinctly contemporary.",
