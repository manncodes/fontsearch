    "detailed_description": "Colourbars (36px) is a bold, italic typeface that blends classic calligraphic influences with a contemporary, playful edge. Its construction is based on a flowing, cursive script, evident in the rounded letterforms and sweeping strokes. The generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive feature is its exaggerated italic angle, which adds a dynamic and energetic feel. This slant, combined with the slightly rounded terminals, creates a sense of movement and informality, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a touch of personality. While its calligraphic roots are evident, Colourbars (36px) avoids being overly traditional, instead embracing a modern, almost whimsical aesthetic. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from playful website designs to bold magazine layouts. The font's overall character is one of confident energy and playful charm, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of personality and visual impact.",
