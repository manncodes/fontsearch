    "detailed_description": "Font2's Block Tilt 88K (36pt) is a bold, geometric sans-serif with a distinct 3D extrusion effect. The letterforms are constructed with sharp, angular corners and straight lines, creating a sense of solidity and structure. The extrusion adds a playful dimension, giving the font a dynamic and energetic feel. The consistent thickness of the strokes and the open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's bold character and playful energy make it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of 80s arcade games and cyberpunk aesthetics, making it a perfect choice for projects that want to capture that nostalgic vibe. However, its bold nature might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
