    "detailed_description": "Kopanyica Strasse is a display typeface that embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its bold, chunky letterforms are built with a distinct geometric foundation, featuring sharp angles and pronounced serifs. The heavy weight and exaggerated proportions create a sense of power and impact, while the rough, distressed texture adds a layer of grit and authenticity. This combination of geometric precision and organic imperfection gives the font a unique character, balancing a sense of order with a touch of chaos. The font's bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and other applications where a strong visual statement is desired. Its distressed texture evokes a sense of vintage machinery, urban grit, and industrial design, making it suitable for projects that seek to convey a sense of authenticity, strength, and rebellion.",
