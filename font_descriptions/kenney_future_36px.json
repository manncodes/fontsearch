    "detailed_description": "Kenney Future is a geometric sans-serif font built on a grid-based construction, resulting in a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. Its sharp, angular terminals and consistent stroke weights contribute to a strong, confident presence. The font's monospaced nature, with each character occupying the same width, adds to its sense of order and precision. This deliberate design evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and digital displays. The font's bold, assertive character makes it ideal for headlines, titles, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its legibility at larger sizes ensures its effectiveness in digital interfaces and signage, while its retro appeal adds a touch of nostalgia and personality to contemporary designs.",
