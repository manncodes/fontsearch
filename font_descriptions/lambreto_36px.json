    "detailed_description": "Lambretto is a playful and expressive font that draws inspiration from hand-drawn lettering styles. Its rounded forms and irregular strokes create a sense of spontaneity and energy, reminiscent of casual handwritten notes or vintage signage. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven stroke weights and slightly angled letterforms add a touch of whimsy. This combination of legibility and personality makes Lambretto suitable for a variety of applications, from playful branding and social media graphics to eye-catching headlines and informal signage. Its casual yet confident character evokes a sense of approachability and warmth, making it ideal for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level.",
