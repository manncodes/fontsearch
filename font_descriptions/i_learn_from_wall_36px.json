    "detailed_description": "This font, \"Learn From Wall\", is a bold and angular display typeface that draws inspiration from both geometric and graffiti aesthetics. Its construction is based on sharp, geometric shapes, with each letterform built from a series of angled lines and sharp corners. This creates a strong, assertive presence, reminiscent of street art and urban environments. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. The exaggerated angles and bold weight give it a dynamic and energetic feel, suggesting movement and impact. While its geometric foundation lends a sense of order and structure, the playful irregularity of the letterforms adds a touch of irreverence and personality. This combination makes it ideal for projects that require a bold statement, a sense of energy, and a touch of rebellious spirit. Its bold, angular forms and high contrast make it particularly effective for large-scale applications, such as posters, murals, and signage, where it can command attention and create a strong visual impact.",
