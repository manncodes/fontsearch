    "detailed_description": "Flipside is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction relies on a combination of sharp angles and rounded corners, creating a balance between rigidity and approachability. The letters are built with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines, resulting in a bold and confident presence. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall design evokes a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video games. This retro-futuristic vibe is further enhanced by the use of bold, contrasting strokes and the inclusion of unique glyphs for punctuation and symbols. Flipside's bold and confident character makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic adds a touch of nostalgia and playfulness, making it ideal for projects that aim to capture a sense of retro-inspired innovation.",
