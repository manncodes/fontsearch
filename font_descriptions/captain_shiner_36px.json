    "detailed_description": "Captain Shiner is a bold, playful display font that utilizes a 3D extrusion effect to create a sense of depth and dimension. The letters are constructed with a simple, geometric base, but the extruded effect adds a playful, almost cartoonish quality. The rounded corners and open counters contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, while the consistent thickness of the strokes ensures strong legibility even at smaller sizes. This font is ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold, eye-catching statement is desired. Its playful nature makes it suitable for branding projects targeting a younger audience or for adding a touch of whimsy to more traditional designs. The 3D effect evokes a sense of retro futurism, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or early 3D animation. This nostalgic quality adds a layer of charm and personality to the font, making it a unique and memorable choice for a variety of projects.",
