    "detailed_description": "Atlanta is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its geometric construction and clean, modern aesthetic. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. The circular forms, particularly in the lowercase 'o' and 'a', are perfectly round, while the straight lines are crisp and unornamented. This combination creates a sense of clarity and simplicity, making the font highly legible even at small sizes. The overall character of Atlanta is one of professionalism and efficiency, with a subtle hint of playfulness in the slightly rounded terminals of some letters. Its clean lines and geometric structure evoke a sense of modernity and technology, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial and interface design. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of ligatures and alternate glyphs, allowing for creative typographic solutions.",
