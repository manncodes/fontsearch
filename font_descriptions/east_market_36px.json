    "detailed_description": "East Market is a bold sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, upright strokes and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's generous x-height and consistent stroke weight contribute to its readability, making it suitable for both large-scale headlines and body text. The overall design evokes a sense of confidence and modernity, with a hint of vintage charm. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for branding, signage, and editorial design, while its versatility allows it to adapt to a range of digital applications, from websites and mobile interfaces to social media graphics and app icons.",
