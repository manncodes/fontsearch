    "detailed_description": "Duvall is a bold, expressive typeface that draws inspiration from classic blackletter styles while incorporating contemporary design sensibilities. Its thick strokes and sharp angles create a strong visual presence, reminiscent of traditional gothic lettering. However, the font's rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions soften the overall impression, lending it a more approachable and modern feel. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Duvall's bold character and distinctive features make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as branding, posters, and headlines. Its versatility allows it to be used across a range of media, from print to digital, adding a touch of vintage charm and contemporary edge.",
