    "detailed_description": "Kelmscott Roman embodies a deliberate blend of historical inspiration and modern legibility. Its roots lie in the late 19th-century revival of medieval typography, evident in the thick, black strokes and the pronounced serifs. However, the font's construction is carefully balanced for contemporary use, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of classic elegance, with a touch of formality that suggests authority and tradition. The font's strong, vertical strokes and consistent weight create a sense of stability and trustworthiness, making it suitable for branding, editorial design, and even digital interfaces where a touch of historical charm is desired.",
