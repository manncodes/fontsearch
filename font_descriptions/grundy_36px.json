    "detailed_description": "Grundy is a display typeface that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering, with a distinct, almost rebellious character. Its construction is based on a combination of organic and geometric forms, resulting in a unique visual language. The letters are often asymmetrical, with varying stroke weights and exaggerated angles, creating a sense of dynamism and spontaneity. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the irregular baseline adds to its hand-drawn aesthetic. This combination of technical precision and expressive freedom makes Grundy suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and branding to informal social media graphics and playful illustrations. Its bold, energetic personality evokes a sense of youthful rebellion and creative expression, making it a perfect choice for projects that demand a unique and memorable visual identity. The font's cultural associations range from street art and graffiti to DIY aesthetics and independent design, reflecting a contemporary spirit of individuality and self-expression.",
