    "detailed_description": "Angie in Love is a display typeface that embraces a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the bold, double-outlined construction, creating a sense of depth and dimension. The outlines are not perfectly smooth, adding a hand-drawn quality that contributes to its whimsical charm. The letterforms themselves are generally rounded and open, with generous counters and a high x-height, ensuring good legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of friendly informality, reminiscent of vintage comic book lettering or playful signage. While its bold outlines and playful nature make it ideal for headlines and eye-catching displays, its legibility and versatility allow it to be used for short blocks of text as well. The font's playful personality and nostalgic feel make it suitable for projects that evoke a sense of fun, nostalgia, or lightheartedness, particularly in branding, packaging, or digital interfaces.",
