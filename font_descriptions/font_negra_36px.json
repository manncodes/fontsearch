    "detailed_description": "Font Negra embodies a bold, gothic aesthetic with a contemporary edge. Its sharp, angular strokes and dramatic serifs evoke the classic blackletter style, but its clean, digital construction and consistent weight distribution give it a modern feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The bold, confident character of Font Negra suggests power, authority, and a touch of mystery, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence. Its historical roots in medieval manuscripts lend it a sense of tradition and craftsmanship, while its digital execution ensures versatility and adaptability for contemporary design needs.",
