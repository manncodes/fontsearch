    "detailed_description": "DK Hand (36px) is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its rounded forms and uneven strokes create a sense of casual informality, reminiscent of a quick note scribbled on paper. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly irregular baseline adds to its hand-drawn charm, while the consistent weight and smooth curves contribute to its overall readability. DK Hand's playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as children's books, social media graphics, or branding for creative businesses. Its casual aesthetic evokes a sense of warmth and authenticity, suggesting a personal touch and a connection to the human hand.",
