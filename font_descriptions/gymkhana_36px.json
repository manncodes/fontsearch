    "detailed_description": "Gymkhana is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, giving it a strong, confident presence. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing it from feeling overly rigid or cold. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. The font's overall character is one of clarity, confidence, and approachability, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a modern, yet timeless aesthetic. Its clean lines and geometric structure evoke a sense of order and precision, while the subtle humanist details add a touch of warmth and personality. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and marketing materials to digital interfaces and editorial design.",
