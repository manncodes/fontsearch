    "detailed_description": "Koshari is a display typeface that embodies the spirit of playful hand-lettering. Its rounded forms and irregular strokes create a sense of casual energy, reminiscent of marker-drawn lettering. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at larger sizes, while the inconsistent stroke weights and playful letterforms add a touch of whimsy. This combination of readability and personality makes Koshari suitable for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a friendly and approachable aesthetic. Its hand-drawn quality evokes a sense of authenticity and warmth, making it ideal for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level. The font's playful nature also lends itself to informal applications like social media graphics, posters, and merchandise, where its energetic character can add a touch of personality and fun.",
