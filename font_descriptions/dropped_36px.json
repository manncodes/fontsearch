    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and multiple outlines, evokes a sense of retrofuturism. The sharp corners and consistent stroke widths create a clean, almost mechanical aesthetic, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or early computer interfaces. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on legibility, featuring open counters and a high x-height, ensuring readability even at smaller sizes. The multiple outlines, while adding visual weight, also contribute to a sense of depth and dimensionality, making the font suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of playful nostalgia, making it ideal for projects that require a bold, retro-inspired visual identity.",
