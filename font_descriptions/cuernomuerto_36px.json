    "detailed_description": "Cuerno Muerto is a hand-drawn typeface that captures the raw energy of freehand lettering. Its irregular strokes and inconsistent letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity, reminiscent of handwritten notes or graffiti. The font's construction is based on a loose, gestural approach, with each letterform exhibiting unique variations in thickness and curvature. This lack of uniformity contributes to its expressive character, making it feel both spontaneous and slightly chaotic. Despite its informality, Cuerno Muerto maintains a degree of legibility, thanks to its relatively open counters and distinct letter shapes. The font's bold, expressive nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and projects that require a strong visual impact. Its raw, unpolished aesthetic evokes a sense of rebellion and individuality, aligning it with contemporary subcultures and street art aesthetics.",
