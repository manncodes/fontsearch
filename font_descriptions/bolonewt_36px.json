    "detailed_description": "Bolonevt is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Bolonevt a versatile personality, suitable for a range of applications from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for both print and screen. Its contemporary feel, reminiscent of mid-century modern design, evokes a sense of optimism and innovation, while its clean lines and neutral character make it adaptable to various styles and contexts.",
