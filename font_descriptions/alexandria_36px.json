    "detailed_description": "Alexandria is a serif typeface that blends classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and timeless. Its strong, upright strokes and consistent, slightly rounded terminals create a sense of balance and clarity. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of confident professionalism, yet with a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance makes Alexandria suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong structure lend themselves well to both traditional print and contemporary digital media, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold. Alexandria's design evokes a sense of stability and reliability, suggesting a brand or message that is both modern and grounded.",
