    "detailed_description": "Crnagorszkji Buddah Orkeszstar is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a rugged, hand-crafted feel. Its bold, chunky letterforms are built with a distinct geometric foundation, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, angular terminals. This geometric structure gives the font a sense of solidity and confidence, while the uneven, slightly distressed edges add a touch of whimsy and informality. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. The font's overall character evokes a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of vintage signage or hand-drawn illustrations. Its playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a hint of nostalgia, while its ruggedness adds a layer of authenticity and grit. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from playful branding to edgy editorial designs, adding a unique visual flair to any project.",
