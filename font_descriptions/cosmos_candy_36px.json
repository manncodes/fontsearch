    "detailed_description": "Cosmos Candy 366 is a playful and expressive display font that draws inspiration from the bold, rounded forms of 1960s and 70s design. Its construction is based on a series of interconnected, organic curves, creating a sense of movement and energy. Each letterform is meticulously crafted, with smooth transitions between curves and a consistent weight throughout. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes. The overall character of Cosmos Candy 366 is one of fun and whimsy, with a retro charm that evokes a sense of nostalgia. Its bold, rounded forms and playful curves suggest a sense of joy and optimism, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a connection to the past. While its playful nature makes it suitable for children's books and branding, its bold presence also lends itself to headlines, posters, and other large-scale applications. The font's retro aesthetic and playful personality make it a perfect choice for projects that aim to capture a sense of fun and nostalgia, while its strong legibility and bold presence ensure that it will always be noticed.",
