    "detailed_description": "Anti Hero Display is a bold, confident display typeface that draws inspiration from classic Western signage and vintage Americana. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and strong serifs, creates a sense of ruggedness and authenticity. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines and branding elements. The font's distinctive features include the exaggerated serifs, which add a touch of whimsy and personality, and the slightly condensed letterforms, which create a sense of dynamism and energy. While rooted in traditional typography, Anti Hero Display feels distinctly modern, with a playful edge that makes it suitable for a wide range of contemporary applications. Its bold character and strong visual presence evoke a sense of adventure and nostalgia, making it perfect for projects that require a touch of Americana charm.",
