    "detailed_description": "Banda PX is a bold and geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the futuristic aesthetics of the 1980s. Its construction is based on a series of overlapping planes, creating a distinctive three-dimensional effect. The letters are composed of sharp, angular forms with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines, resulting in a rigid and structured appearance. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The bold weight and contrasting strokes contribute to a sense of power and authority, while the subtle rounded corners soften the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly aggressive. Banda PX is a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and logos to futuristic interfaces and graphic design elements. Its strong visual presence and retro-futuristic aesthetic make it particularly well-suited for projects that require a sense of energy, dynamism, and technological advancement. The font's cultural associations evoke a sense of nostalgia for the 1980s, a time of technological innovation and bold design experimentation.",
