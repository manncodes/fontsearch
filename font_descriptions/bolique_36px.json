    "detailed_description": "This sans-serif typeface exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its precise construction and consistent proportions. The letterforms are characterized by a distinct lack of curves, with sharp angles and straight lines dominating their structure. This geometric approach lends a sense of clarity and order, making the font feel both modern and timeless. The overall character is bold and confident, with a slight mechanical feel that suggests efficiency and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from large-scale signage to digital interfaces. Its bold presence and clean lines evoke a sense of authority and professionalism, making it ideal for corporate branding, technical documentation, and contemporary design projects. The font's geometric nature and lack of ornamentation suggest a minimalist aesthetic, aligning it with modern design trends that prioritize simplicity and functionality.",
