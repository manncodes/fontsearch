    "detailed_description": "Angoletta is a playful script font that balances a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a degree of formal structure. Its flowing curves and rounded terminals create a sense of movement and informality, while the consistent stroke weights and well-defined letterforms maintain a sense of legibility and control. The font's overall character is friendly and approachable, suggesting a sense of warmth and personality. It draws inspiration from traditional calligraphic scripts, but its contemporary execution and digital-friendly design make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Angoletta's versatility allows it to be used for everything from handwritten notes and personal branding to website headers and social media graphics, adding a touch of charm and personality to any project. While its flowing nature might limit its use in large blocks of text, its legibility and character make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other display applications.",
