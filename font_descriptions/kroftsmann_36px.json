    "detailed_description": "Kroftmann is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly stylized, with angular terminals and a strong emphasis on verticality. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its bold presence and excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy. It evokes a sense of futuristic technology and retro-inspired design, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. Kroftmann is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold nature and geometric construction make it ideal for large-scale applications, while its retro-futuristic vibe adds a unique and memorable touch to contemporary designs.",
