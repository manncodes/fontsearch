    "detailed_description": "Jeopardize 84H is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, angular letterforms with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths. The high x-height and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale display and smaller text sizes. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of retrofuturistic flair. Its angularity and bold weight evoke a sense of power and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the edges, adding a hint of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Jeopardize 84H versatile for a range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and retro-inspired aesthetic make it particularly well-suited for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of nostalgia.",
