    "detailed_description": "Forta is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and precise angles, giving it a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall geometric aesthetic. This combination of sharp angles and rounded details creates a unique visual tension, making the font both modern and nostalgic. Forta's bold weight and confident stance make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, making it suitable for projects that aim to convey a sense of innovation and progress. However, its strong geometric nature might limit its use in body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
