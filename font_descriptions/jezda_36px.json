    "detailed_description": "Jezda EX is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinctive, almost architectural, quality. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of solidity and precision. The letters are designed with a consistent width, resulting in a highly legible and balanced appearance. The unique feature of Jezda EX is its intricate, almost pixelated, texture, which adds a layer of visual interest and depth. This texture, reminiscent of early digital graphics or even a brick wall, gives the font a retro-futuristic feel, suggesting a blend of classic geometric design with a modern, digital edge. While the font's bold weight and sharp angles make it suitable for headlines and display purposes, its legibility and unique texture also make it suitable for smaller text sizes, particularly in digital applications where its retro-futuristic aesthetic can add a touch of personality to user interfaces or branding elements.",
