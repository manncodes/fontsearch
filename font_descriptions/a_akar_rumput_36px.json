    "detailed_description": "Akar Rumput is a display typeface that embodies the energy of hand-drawn lettering, capturing a sense of immediacy and playful personality. Its construction is based on a series of overlapping strokes, creating a textured and dynamic visual. The irregular line weights and exaggerated letterforms contribute to its expressive character, while the overall structure remains legible and balanced. The font's bold and confident presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its playful nature also lends itself well to informal applications like posters, social media graphics, and even children's books. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and creativity, suggesting a connection to the human touch and a rejection of overly polished digital design.",
