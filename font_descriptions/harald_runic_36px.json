    "detailed_description": "This font draws inspiration from ancient runes, reinterpreting their angular forms with a contemporary edge. The glyphs are constructed with sharp, geometric strokes, creating a bold and assertive presence. The consistent width of the strokes and the tight letter spacing contribute to a sense of uniformity and order, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the overall impression. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives the font a unique character, making it suitable for both bold headlines and more nuanced body text. Its strong visual impact and historical associations make it ideal for projects that require a sense of power, mystery, or heritage, particularly in digital contexts where its sharp lines and clear legibility translate well to screen displays.",
