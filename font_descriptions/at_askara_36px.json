    "detailed_description": "At Askara, a geometric sans-serif typeface, clean lines and precise angles meet a subtle humanist touch. The font's construction is rooted in a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and balanced relationships between letterforms. This geometric foundation lends a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying professionalism without sacrificing a sense of human connection. Askara's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of ligatures and stylistic alternates, allowing for creative customization. The font's clean and uncluttered aesthetic evokes a sense of simplicity and efficiency, aligning with contemporary design trends that prioritize clarity and functionality. Its subtle humanist details, however, prevent it from feeling overly sterile, suggesting a balance between modern efficiency and human warmth.",
