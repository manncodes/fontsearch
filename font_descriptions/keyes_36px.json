    "detailed_description": "Keyes is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a balance between geometric precision and organic warmth. Its construction is rooted in a strong, consistent grid system, evident in the uniform stroke widths and the precise angles of its letterforms. However, the font avoids a purely geometric rigidity by incorporating subtle curves and rounded terminals, particularly in the lowercase letters. This interplay between structure and fluidity creates a sense of both clarity and approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making Keyes suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of confidence and professionalism, while the subtle warmth of its curves suggests a friendly and approachable personality. Keyes's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of sophistication and accessibility.",
