    "detailed_description": "Figno is a bold sans-serif typeface that exudes a playful yet confident personality. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the edges, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and organic curves gives Figno a unique character, making it both modern and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to digital interfaces and signage. Figno's bold weight and playful nature evoke a sense of energy and optimism, reminiscent of the graphic design trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of confidence and approachability, making it ideal for brands that want to connect with a modern audience.",
