    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the precise construction of angles. The uppercase letters, particularly the 'A' and 'M', showcase a distinct verticality, creating a sense of formality and structure. The lowercase letters, however, introduce a subtle humanist touch with their rounded terminals and slightly asymmetrical forms, adding a touch of approachability to the overall design. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth creates a unique character, making the font feel both modern and timeless. The font's bold weight and strong contrast contribute to its confident and assertive personality, while the clean lines and consistent stroke widths ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of classic elegance, reminiscent of early 20th-century design, yet its clean lines and contemporary proportions make it feel relevant and fresh for modern applications.",
