    "detailed_description": "Allejo is a contemporary serif typeface that blends classic construction with a modern sensibility. Its geometric foundation is evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, particularly in the uppercase letters. However, the subtle humanist details, like the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric structure and humanist nuance creates a typeface that feels both sophisticated and inviting. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall character of Allejo is one of confident clarity and understated elegance, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold.",
