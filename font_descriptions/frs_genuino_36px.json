    "detailed_description": "This font's bold, angular forms are reminiscent of graffiti and street art, drawing inspiration from the dynamic energy of urban environments. The letters are constructed with sharp, geometric shapes, creating a sense of immediacy and impact. The exaggerated angles and uneven strokes add to the font's raw, unpolished aesthetic, evoking a sense of rebellion and individuality. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and short bursts of text. Its bold personality and street-inspired aesthetic make it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of urban cool. The font's cultural associations with youth culture, rebellion, and street art make it a powerful tool for expressing a sense of individuality and nonconformity.",
