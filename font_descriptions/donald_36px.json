    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a raw, energetic spirit, reminiscent of hand-painted signage or graffiti art. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by bold strokes and dynamic angles, create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The uneven baseline and varying letter widths contribute to the font's hand-drawn aesthetic, while the sharp terminals and pronounced serifs add a touch of aggression. Despite its informality, the font maintains a surprising level of legibility, thanks to its clear stroke contrast and open counters. This makes it suitable for headlines, branding elements, and even short-form text, where its bold personality can inject a dose of street-inspired energy. The font's cultural associations range from urban subcultures to DIY aesthetics, evoking a sense of rebellion and creative expression.",
