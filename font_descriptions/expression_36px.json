    "detailed_description": "Font: Expression (36px) is a playful and expressive typeface that blends a hand-drawn aesthetic with a touch of digital polish. Its rounded forms and irregular letterforms create a sense of whimsy and informality, while the consistent stroke weights and clean terminals maintain a degree of readability. The font's overall character is friendly and approachable, suggesting a sense of warmth and personality. It draws inspiration from classic hand-lettered styles, but with a contemporary twist that makes it feel fresh and relevant. The font's irregular baseline and slight variations in letter spacing add to its dynamic and energetic feel. While its hand-drawn nature might limit its use in formal settings, it excels in casual applications like branding, social media graphics, and playful headlines. Its informal yet legible nature makes it ideal for conveying a sense of fun and personality, particularly in digital environments.",
