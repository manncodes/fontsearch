    "detailed_description": "Elektora is a geometric sans-serif typeface built on a grid system, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp corners, straight lines, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of precision and order. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is bold and confident, with a touch of futuristic flair. Its geometric nature evokes a sense of technology and efficiency, while the sharp angles and bold forms suggest a sense of power and authority. This makes Elektora well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its clean lines and modern feel make it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to tech-focused websites.",
