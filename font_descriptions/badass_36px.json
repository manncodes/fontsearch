    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters constructed from clean, precise lines and sharp angles. The consistent stroke weight and uniform proportions create a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist typography. The overall character is both confident and approachable, with a subtle playfulness evident in the slightly rounded terminals of certain letters, such as 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail lends the font a timeless quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold. The font evokes a sense of modernism and functionality, suggesting a connection to technology and innovation, while also retaining a classic elegance that transcends trends.",
