    "detailed_description": "Font Blitz 3DX, designed by Vladimir Nikoli\u0107, is a bold, playful display typeface that utilizes a 3D extrusion effect to create a sense of depth and dimension. The letters are constructed with a geometric foundation, featuring sharp corners and clean lines, but the extrusion adds a playful, almost cartoonish quality. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the exaggerated 3D effect adds a sense of dynamism and energy. This font is ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its playful nature makes it suitable for projects targeting a younger audience or conveying a sense of fun and excitement. The 3D effect evokes a sense of retro nostalgia, reminiscent of 1980s video games and early computer graphics, while its bold, confident character also suggests a modern, digital-native aesthetic.",
