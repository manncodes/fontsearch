    "detailed_description": "Aerobus Dotty is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, angular shapes with a slight roundedness to the terminals, creating a balance between modern clarity and a touch of playful whimsy. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The overall character of the font is confident and energetic, with a hint of retro charm that evokes the aesthetics of 1980s sci-fi and video game design. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that require a bold, eye-catching visual identity with a touch of nostalgia. While its geometric construction lends itself to clean, modern designs, the subtle roundedness and playful details prevent it from feeling overly sterile or corporate. This versatility allows it to be used effectively in a wide range of contexts, from branding and packaging to website design and mobile interfaces.",
