    "detailed_description": "Cony is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric sans-serifs. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly legible and balanced appearance. The letterforms are characterized by their consistent stroke weights, open counters, and slightly rounded terminals. This combination creates a sense of both clarity and approachability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's overall character is confident and professional, yet it retains a friendly and approachable feel. This balance is achieved through the subtle interplay of geometric precision and humanist details. Cony's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate into digital interfaces and print media, while its historical influences can be traced back to the geometric sans-serifs of the early 20th century. The font's cultural associations evoke a sense of modernity, efficiency, and clarity, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a clean and professional aesthetic.",
