    "detailed_description": "Data Sun is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are characterized by their rectangular shapes, with rounded corners that soften the overall impression. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and strong verticality convey a sense of confidence and authority, while the rounded corners and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of approachability. This combination of boldness and approachability makes Data Sun suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital signage. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of the 1980s and early 1990s. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to capture a sense of nostalgia or futuristic vision.",
