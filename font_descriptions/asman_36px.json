    "detailed_description": "Asman is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a surprisingly legible structure. Its bold, chunky forms are built on a geometric foundation, with rounded corners and exaggerated curves that give it a whimsical feel. The letterforms are intentionally uneven, with varying stroke weights and irregular outlines that create a sense of hand-drawn spontaneity. This irregularity, however, is carefully controlled, ensuring that the font remains readable even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a font that feels both playful and confident, suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While its playful nature might suggest limited use cases, Asman's legibility and versatility make it suitable for a wider range of applications than initially expected, particularly in digital environments where its bold forms and unique character can stand out.",
