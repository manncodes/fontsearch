    "detailed_description": "This font, constructed entirely from horizontal and vertical lines, embodies a stark, geometric aesthetic. Its rigid structure, reminiscent of early digital displays or architectural blueprints, creates a sense of order and precision. The uniform stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to a clean, uncluttered appearance, while the slightly rounded corners of some characters, like 'a' and 'e', introduce a subtle touch of humanity. This balance between strict geometry and softened edges prevents the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. Its bold, confident presence makes it suitable for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its limited character set and lack of stylistic variations might limit its use in extended text blocks or applications requiring nuanced expression.",
