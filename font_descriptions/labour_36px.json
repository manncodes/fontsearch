    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric construction, with characters built from clean, rectilinear shapes. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a sense of precision and order. The overall structure is slightly condensed, with a moderate x-height that ensures good legibility even at smaller sizes. The lowercase letters maintain a consistent baseline, while the uppercase letters have a slight vertical emphasis, adding a touch of formality. This combination of geometric precision and subtle verticality creates a font that feels both modern and timeless, evoking a sense of efficiency and clarity. Its clean lines and strong structure make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. The font's inherent orderliness and clarity suggest a sense of control and structure, making it particularly well-suited for projects that require a sense of professionalism and authority.",
