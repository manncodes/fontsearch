    "detailed_description": "Besamo PX is a display typeface that embodies a playful retro aesthetic. Its bold, three-dimensional construction, achieved through a pronounced shadow effect, gives it a distinct vintage feel reminiscent of 1970s and 80s graphic design. The geometrically-inspired letterforms, with their sharp angles and strong contrasts, contribute to a sense of energy and dynamism. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. While its retro charm might seem nostalgic, Besamo PX also possesses a contemporary edge, its bold presence and playful nature making it a compelling choice for projects seeking a unique and eye-catching visual identity. The font's inherent boldness and playful nature make it ideal for projects that aim to stand out and evoke a sense of fun and nostalgia.",
