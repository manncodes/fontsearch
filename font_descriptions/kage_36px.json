    "detailed_description": "Kage is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that exudes a confident and modern aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in precise geometric forms, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths. The letterforms are tightly spaced, creating a sense of density and visual impact. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Kage is assertive and contemporary, with a hint of retro influence. Its strong, geometric forms evoke a sense of precision and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the edges, adding a touch of approachability. This balance makes Kage suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence and modern sensibility make it a compelling choice for projects that require a strong visual statement. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the minimalist design trends of the mid-20th century, while its sharp, geometric forms resonate with the digital aesthetic of today.",
