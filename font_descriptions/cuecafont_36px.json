    "detailed_description": "Cuecafont is a playful and expressive display typeface that draws inspiration from hand-drawn lettering. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves create a sense of whimsy and energy, while the textured strokes add a touch of handmade authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at larger sizes. The overall effect is one of friendly informality, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a casual and approachable tone is desired. The font's playful nature is further enhanced by the inclusion of a variety of ligatures and alternate glyphs, allowing for creative customization. While its bold and expressive nature makes it well-suited for digital applications, its hand-drawn aesthetic also lends itself to traditional print media, particularly for projects with a vintage or nostalgic feel.",
