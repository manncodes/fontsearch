    "detailed_description": "Handform is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its rounded, almost cartoonish letterforms are built upon a geometric foundation, with each character exhibiting a distinct, almost hand-drawn quality. The generous curves and rounded terminals create a sense of warmth and approachability, while the bold weight and consistent stroke width ensure strong legibility even at large sizes. This combination of playful personality and robust construction makes Handform ideal for headlines, branding elements, and playful digital interfaces. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the playful graphics of the 1970s and 1980s, while its bold presence feels distinctly modern. Handform's playful nature and strong legibility make it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of whimsy and a confident visual presence.",
