    "detailed_description": "This font's bold, blocky forms are built on a geometric foundation, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths. The letters are constructed with a clear emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines, creating a sense of solidity and stability. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro charm. The font's bold presence evokes a sense of strength and authority, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro aesthetic, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics and early computer interfaces, adds a playful and nostalgic element, making it ideal for projects that seek to tap into a sense of retro-futurism or digital nostalgia.",
