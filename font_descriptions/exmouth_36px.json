    "detailed_description": "Exmouth is a calligraphic script typeface that embodies a classic elegance with a touch of contemporary flair. Its flowing strokes and graceful curves are reminiscent of traditional copperplate script, yet its slightly bolder weight and more open counters lend it a modern sensibility. The font's construction is characterized by a consistent rhythm of thick and thin strokes, creating a sense of fluidity and movement. The ascenders and descenders are well-proportioned, ensuring legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of sophistication and refinement, making it suitable for a range of applications from formal invitations and branding to website headers and social media graphics. Exmouth's subtle playfulness and inherent charm make it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of personality and visual appeal.",
