    "detailed_description": "This font's bold, angular forms are reminiscent of early video game graphics and 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. The characters are constructed with sharp, geometric shapes, creating a sense of energy and dynamism. The wide, open counters and generous x-height ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The font's overall character is assertive and confident, with a playful edge that hints at a retro-futuristic sensibility. It's well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold, attention-grabbing presence is desired. The font's cultural associations evoke a sense of nostalgia for a time of technological innovation and playful experimentation, while its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to inject a dose of retro cool into modern design.",
