    "detailed_description": "Ales & Hegar Raw (36pt) is a decorative font that blends intricate flourishes with a strong, geometric foundation. Each letterform is constructed with a series of carefully balanced curves and angles, creating a sense of both elegance and structure. The font's distinctive feature is its use of ornate embellishments, often resembling stylized flowers or leaves, which are integrated seamlessly into the letterforms. These embellishments add a touch of whimsy and sophistication, while maintaining a clear and legible form. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a range of applications. Its bold character and intricate details evoke a sense of vintage charm and craftsmanship, reminiscent of traditional calligraphy and illuminated manuscripts. This font is ideal for adding a touch of elegance and personality to branding, packaging, invitations, and other projects where a decorative and visually engaging aesthetic is desired.",
