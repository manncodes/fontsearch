    "detailed_description": "Killam is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Killam versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and human connection. Killam's design echoes the spirit of mid-century modernism, with its clean lines and emphasis on functionality, but it also feels distinctly contemporary, with its balanced proportions and subtle details.",
