    "detailed_description": "Cousin is a handwritten script font that captures the casual, expressive nature of everyday writing. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's organic construction, with its varying line weights and subtle calligraphic flourishes, evokes the feeling of a personal note or a handwritten journal entry. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, Cousin maintains a level of legibility through its clear letterforms and consistent baseline. This makes it suitable for a range of applications, from casual social media posts to more formal branding elements, where a touch of personality is desired. The font's inherent warmth and approachability make it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level, conveying a sense of authenticity and human connection.",
