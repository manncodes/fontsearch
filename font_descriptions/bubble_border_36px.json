    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement in geometric sans-serif design, built on a grid system with sharp, angular forms. The letterforms are constructed with a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of uniformity and strength. The open counters and generous x-height contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of confident clarity and modern edge, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. This font is well-suited for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of authority and technological advancement, making it ideal for projects that require a futuristic or industrial aesthetic.",
