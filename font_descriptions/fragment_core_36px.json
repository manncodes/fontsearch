    "detailed_description": "Fragment Core exhibits a clean, contemporary aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a high x-height, contributing to its strong legibility. The open counters and well-defined terminals enhance readability, particularly at smaller sizes. While the overall structure is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance creates a font that feels both modern and inviting. Fragment Core's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces and branding materials to editorial design and even print publications. Its clean lines and contemporary feel align well with digital-native design trends, while its inherent readability ensures its effectiveness across various media and sizes. The font evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and a touch of optimism, reflecting the values often associated with contemporary design and technology.",
