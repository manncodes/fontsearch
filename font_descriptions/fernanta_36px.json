    "detailed_description": "Fernanta is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost whimsical aesthetic with a strong structural foundation. Its defining characteristic is the use of organic, flowing curves that form the basis of each letterform. These curves are not simply decorative flourishes; they are integral to the construction of the letters, creating a sense of movement and energy. The curves are often paired with sharp, angular terminals, adding a touch of contrast and dynamism. This combination of organic and geometric elements gives Fernanta a unique personality, balancing a sense of whimsy with a strong visual presence. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a range of applications, from headlines and logos to packaging and web design. Its playful nature makes it particularly well-suited for projects that require a touch of personality and charm, while its structural integrity ensures that it can be used effectively in more formal contexts as well. Fernanta's overall character evokes a sense of playful sophistication, suggesting a brand that is both fun and intelligent. Its organic forms and flowing curves create a sense of movement and energy, while its sharp terminals and strong structural foundation provide a sense of stability and confidence.",
