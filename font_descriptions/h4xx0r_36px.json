    "detailed_description": "H4XX0R 369X is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated angles and a distinct lack of curves. This creates a strong, assertive presence, reminiscent of early digital typography and the aesthetics of cyberpunk culture. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold character and futuristic aesthetic make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as branding for tech companies, gaming interfaces, or cyberpunk-inspired designs. However, its highly stylized nature might limit its use in more traditional or formal contexts.",
