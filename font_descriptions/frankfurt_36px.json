    "detailed_description": "Frankfurt is a display typeface that utilizes a bold, three-dimensional extrusion effect to create a sense of depth and playful dimensionality. The letterforms are constructed with a geometric foundation, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, angular terminals. This geometric structure lends a sense of order and clarity to the design, while the exaggerated extrusion adds a touch of whimsy and visual interest. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its legibility, ensuring readability even at larger sizes. The overall character of Frankfurt is bold and confident, with a playful edge that suggests a sense of fun and energy. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the bold graphic design of the 1970s and 1980s, while its contemporary execution makes it feel fresh and relevant for modern applications. Frankfurt is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other display applications where its bold presence and playful personality can make a strong visual impact. Its three-dimensional effect can be particularly effective in digital environments, where it can add a sense of depth and interactivity to user interfaces and animations.",
