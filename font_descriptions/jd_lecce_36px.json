    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. The letterforms are based on a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially at smaller sizes. The overall weight is light, creating a sense of airiness and refinement. The font's design personality is characterized by its confident simplicity and understated elegance. It evokes a sense of professionalism and modernity, while remaining approachable and inviting. The font's historical influences are evident in its geometric construction, reminiscent of early 20th-century sans-serif designs. However, the subtle humanist details and overall lightness distinguish it from more austere geometric fonts. Its contemporary relevance lies in its versatility and adaptability to various digital applications, from website design to mobile interfaces. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for both large and small text sizes, while its understated elegance adds a touch of sophistication to any project. ",
