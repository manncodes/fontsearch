    "detailed_description": "Bolton is a display typeface that embodies a classic, almost vintage aesthetic with a modern twist. Its construction is based on a strong geometric foundation, evident in the consistent width of the strokes and the precise angles of the letterforms. The overall design is reminiscent of Art Deco typography, with its bold, confident strokes and decorative flourishes. However, Bolton avoids being overly ornate, opting for a clean and legible style that feels contemporary. The double-outline effect adds a layer of depth and dimension, creating a sense of visual interest and a subtle retro feel. This combination of classic and modern elements makes Bolton suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and logos to headlines and posters. Its bold presence and playful personality make it ideal for projects that require a touch of vintage charm without sacrificing readability.",
