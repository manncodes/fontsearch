    "detailed_description": "Cosmos is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct digital aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise angles and clean lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are highly legible, with a consistent stroke weight and open counters that ensure readability even at small sizes. The font's overall character is modern and minimalist, with a touch of retro influence. It evokes the era of early personal computers and the rise of digital technology, suggesting a sense of innovation and progress. Cosmos is well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts where a clean, modern, and slightly nostalgic feel is desired. Its versatility allows it to be used for both large-scale headlines and smaller body text, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of design projects.",
