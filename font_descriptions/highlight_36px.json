    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a strong emphasis on linearity. The letterforms are composed of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of precision and order. The overall proportions are balanced and consistent, with a moderate x-height and open counters that contribute to good legibility. The terminals are sharp and well-defined, adding to the font's crisp and modern aesthetic. While the geometric foundation provides a sense of formality, the subtle curves in certain characters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanism gives the font a contemporary feel, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and user experiences. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it particularly effective for headlines and display typography, while its versatility allows it to be used effectively in body text as well. The overall impression is one of clarity, confidence, and modernity, suggesting a brand or message that is both sophisticated and accessible.",
