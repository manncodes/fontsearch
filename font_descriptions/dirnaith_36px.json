    "detailed_description": "Dirmaith is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from vintage stencil lettering, but with a contemporary edge. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean, angular forms and consistent stroke widths, creating a strong, confident presence. The letterforms are designed with a distinct, almost mechanical feel, featuring sharp terminals and a slight inward slant, adding a touch of dynamism. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric precision and subtle dynamism gives Dirmaith a unique personality, balancing a sense of authority with a hint of playfulness. It's a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its vintage-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, while its contemporary edge makes it feel fresh and relevant. Dirmaith's bold, confident character makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, while its versatility allows it to adapt to a variety of styles and contexts.",
