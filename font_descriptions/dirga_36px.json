    "detailed_description": "Dirga is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost architectural presence. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of solidity and confidence. The letters are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are cut sharply, adding to the font's assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase letters, like the 'a' and 'o', introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives Dirga a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for headlines, branding, signage, and even editorial design, adding a modern and confident feel to any project. Dirga's bold presence and strong legibility make it particularly effective for digital interfaces, where it can convey a sense of authority and clarity. Its geometric construction and sharp angles also evoke a sense of modernity and innovation, making it a good choice for projects that want to communicate a forward-thinking and progressive message.",
