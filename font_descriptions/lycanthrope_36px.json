    "detailed_description": "Lycanthrope is a display typeface that embodies a raw, primal energy. Its construction is characterized by sharp, jagged strokes that evoke the imagery of claws and fangs. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated ascenders and descenders that create a sense of dramatic tension. The overall effect is one of aggression and untamed power, reminiscent of classic horror movie fonts. While the font's sharp angles and irregular forms might make it challenging for extended reading, its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where impact is paramount. The font's dark and edgy aesthetic aligns with contemporary trends in horror and fantasy media, suggesting a sense of mystery and the unknown. Its bold, dramatic character makes it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of danger, excitement, and the supernatural.",
