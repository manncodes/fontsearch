    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, double-lined construction, evokes a sense of retrofuturism. The geometric shapes of the letters, particularly the uppercase, are reminiscent of 1960s and 70s graphic design, with a strong emphasis on clean lines and bold forms. The lowercase letters, while still geometric, have a slightly more playful and organic feel, with rounded terminals and subtle curves. This contrast adds a touch of personality and approachability to the overall design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text. The bold, graphic nature of the font lends itself well to headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its retro aesthetic might not be suitable for all contexts, particularly those requiring a more contemporary or minimalist feel.",
