    "detailed_description": "Bernardo Moda Contrast is a striking display typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its uppercase letters are characterized by strong verticality and sharp angles, reminiscent of Art Deco typography. The lowercase, however, introduces a touch of fluidity with rounded terminals and graceful curves, creating a balanced contrast between formality and approachability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the generous stroke weights and bold contrasts add a sense of drama and sophistication. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Bernardo Moda Contrast suitable for a wide range of applications, from elegant branding and editorial design to eye-catching headlines and digital interfaces. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of vintage glamour and sophistication, while its contemporary design sensibilities ensure its relevance in modern design contexts.",
