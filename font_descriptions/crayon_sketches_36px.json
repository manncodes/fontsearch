    "detailed_description": "Crayon Sketches (36px) is a playful, handwritten script font that captures the immediacy and informality of childhood scribbles. Its irregular letterforms, with their uneven strokes and slightly wobbly lines, evoke the spontaneous nature of drawing with crayons. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for casual digital applications like social media posts or website headers. The font's inherent imperfection adds a touch of charm and authenticity, suggesting a personal touch and a sense of warmth. While its technical construction is intentionally loose, the font's overall character is surprisingly consistent, creating a sense of playful energy that is both endearing and engaging.",
