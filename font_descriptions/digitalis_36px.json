    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. The letterforms are based on a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially at smaller sizes. The overall weight is light, creating a sense of airiness and modernity. The font's design evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, reminiscent of mid-century modernism, yet its subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly sterile. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. Its clean lines and strong legibility ensure readability across various media, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for both formal and informal contexts.",
