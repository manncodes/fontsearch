    "detailed_description": "Frazle is a display typeface that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering with a playful, almost chaotic energy. Its construction is based on a combination of geometric and organic forms, resulting in a unique visual language. The letters are defined by a series of overlapping strokes, creating a sense of depth and texture. This technique, reminiscent of brush lettering, adds a dynamic quality to the font, making it feel both casual and expressive. The uneven stroke weights and slightly irregular letterforms contribute to the font's hand-drawn aesthetic, while the overall structure remains legible and consistent. Frazzle's bold and playful personality makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality. Its casual yet impactful nature lends itself well to digital applications, particularly in web design and social media graphics. The font's inherent energy and playful nature evoke a sense of youthful exuberance and creativity, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to capture a sense of fun and spontaneity.",
