    "detailed_description": "Lye Mue Look Kreung is a playful yet legible sans-serif typeface that blends a hand-drawn aesthetic with a touch of geometric precision. The rounded terminals and slightly irregular letterforms create a sense of warmth and approachability, while the consistent stroke weights and balanced proportions ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is both friendly and modern, suggesting a casual yet sophisticated tone. Its origins in hand-lettering are evident in the subtle variations in stroke thickness and the gentle curves of the letterforms, while the geometric underpinnings provide a sense of order and structure. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to website design and social media graphics. Its casual yet refined personality makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality without sacrificing professionalism.",
