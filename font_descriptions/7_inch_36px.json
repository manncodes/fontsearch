    "detailed_description": "This font is a striking example of a geometric sans-serif, built on a grid system that gives it a clean, modern aesthetic. The letterforms are constructed with precise angles and straight lines, resulting in a strong, confident presence. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke weights further enhance readability, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. While the overall impression is one of starkness and precision, the font avoids feeling cold or sterile. Subtle variations in the terminal strokes, such as the slightly rounded corners on the 'a' and 'e', introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanism makes the font feel both contemporary and timeless, suitable for a wide range of projects from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and mobile applications. Its clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of clarity and efficiency, making it ideal for conveying information and ideas with precision and impact.",
