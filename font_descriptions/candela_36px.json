    "detailed_description": "Candela is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a contemporary balance between geometric clarity and subtle humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles of its letterforms. However, the font avoids a purely rigid aesthetic by incorporating subtle curves and rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g'. This combination creates a visual harmony that feels both modern and approachable. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making Candela suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Its clean lines and neutral character make it a versatile choice for both corporate branding and editorial design, while the subtle curves and rounded terminals add a touch of approachability that prevents it from feeling overly formal. Candela's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of contemporary sophistication, suggesting a balance between efficiency and elegance, a quality that resonates with the digital age's emphasis on both functionality and visual appeal.",
