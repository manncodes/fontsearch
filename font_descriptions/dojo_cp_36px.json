    "detailed_description": "Dojo is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its construction is based on simple, rounded forms with strong, contrasting strokes, creating a visually striking and easily recognizable aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the rounded terminals and playful curves add a touch of approachability. This combination of bold geometry and subtle humanism makes Dojo suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and branding to playful digital interfaces and retro-inspired designs. Its strong visual presence and playful personality evoke a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of 1960s and 70s graphic design, while its clean lines and modern construction ensure its relevance in contemporary digital contexts.",
