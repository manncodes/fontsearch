    "detailed_description": "Cuyabra is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are characterized by their clean lines, open counters, and consistent stroke weights, creating a sense of clarity and legibility. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Cuyabra suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its contemporary aesthetic evokes a sense of efficiency and innovation, while its subtle warmth ensures a welcoming and approachable feel. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a range of punctuation marks and symbols, making it suitable for both short and long-form text.",
