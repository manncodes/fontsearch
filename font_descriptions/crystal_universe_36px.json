    "detailed_description": "Crystal Universe is a playful and bold display typeface that draws inspiration from the graphic design trends of the 1970s. Its rounded, bulbous letterforms are constructed with a strong emphasis on geometric shapes, creating a sense of playful energy and retro charm. The font's distinctive feature is the inclusion of a star motif within each uppercase letter, adding a whimsical touch and a sense of visual interest. The star's placement varies across the alphabet, creating a dynamic and unpredictable rhythm. The bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other eye-catching applications. The font's retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and fun, reminiscent of vintage arcade games, psychedelic posters, and disco-era graphics. Its playful nature makes it suitable for projects that aim to capture a sense of lightheartedness and retro cool, while its bold presence ensures it will stand out in any context.",
