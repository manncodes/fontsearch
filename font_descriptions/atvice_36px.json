    "detailed_description": "Atvice 36px is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural proportions, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the sharp, unornamented terminals. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, ensuring clarity even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is one of starkness and modernity, the slight rounding of the terminals and the subtle curves in letters like 'a' and 'c' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance gives Atvice 36px a versatile character, suitable for both contemporary digital interfaces and traditional print applications. Its clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold. The typeface's contemporary design language suggests a connection to the digital age, while its underlying geometric structure hints at a timeless quality, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a balance of modernity and sophistication.",
