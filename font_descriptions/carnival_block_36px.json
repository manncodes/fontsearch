    "detailed_description": "Carnival Block (PX) is a playful display font that embraces a hand-drawn aesthetic with a touch of geometric structure. The letters are built with bold, blocky forms, often featuring rounded corners and playful details like internal lines and dots. This combination creates a unique visual language that is both whimsical and legible. The font's irregular baseline and varying letter heights add to its hand-crafted charm, while the consistent stroke weight and clear counter forms ensure readability even at smaller sizes. Carnival Block (PX) is a font that evokes a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of vintage carnival signage or hand-drawn illustrations. Its bold, playful nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and playful designs, adding a touch of whimsy and personality to any project.",
