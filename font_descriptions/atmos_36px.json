    "detailed_description": "Almos is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a bold, futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, geometric shapes, with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The terminals are often squared off, adding to the font's angularity and sense of precision. The overall effect is one of starkness and clarity, reminiscent of early digital interfaces and science fiction imagery. Almos is designed for high-impact applications, particularly in digital environments. Its bold weight and clear legibility make it suitable for headlines, branding, and user interface elements. However, its strong personality and futuristic connotations may limit its use in more traditional contexts. The font's bold, geometric forms evoke a sense of power, technology, and the future, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence and a sense of innovation.",
