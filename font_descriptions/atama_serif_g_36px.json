    "detailed_description": "Atama Serif G 36px is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, geometric shapes with rounded corners, giving it a clean and modern aesthetic. The letters are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at smaller sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of playfulness and approachability, balancing the geometric rigidity. This font evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of 1970s science fiction and futuristic design. Its bold presence and clear readability make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact and a touch of retro charm are desired.",
