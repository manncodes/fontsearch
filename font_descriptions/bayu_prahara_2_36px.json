    "detailed_description": "Bayu Prahara 2 is a script font that captures the essence of casual handwritten lettering, yet possesses a refined structure that makes it suitable for a range of applications. The font's organic curves and flowing strokes create a sense of natural movement, reminiscent of a quick, confident hand. The letterforms are designed with a slight slant, adding a dynamic feel to the overall composition. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's playful personality is further enhanced by the inclusion of ligatures and alternate glyphs, allowing for subtle variations in style and expression. While the font's overall aesthetic leans towards informality, the careful attention to detail and consistent stroke weight give it a polished and professional feel. This balance makes it ideal for branding projects, social media graphics, and even editorial design, where a touch of personality is desired without sacrificing readability.",
