    "detailed_description": "Frostbite is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp angles and precise intersections, creating a bold and assertive presence. The letterforms are highly condensed, with a low x-height and minimal spacing, contributing to a sense of density and power. The terminals are often cut off abruptly, adding to the raw and unfinished feel. This combination of geometric precision and deliberate imperfection gives Frostbite a unique character, balancing a sense of order with a hint of chaos. While its bold and angular nature might seem aggressive at first glance, the font's legibility remains strong, particularly in larger sizes. This makes it suitable for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Frostbite's angularity and condensed form evoke a sense of industrial strength and technological advancement, reminiscent of cyberpunk aesthetics and futuristic urban landscapes. It suggests a world of hard edges and stark contrasts, where technology and human experience collide.",
