    "detailed_description": "FM College Team is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, geometric construction and a distinct double-stroke outline. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean, consistent appearance. The double-stroke creates a sense of depth and dimension, adding visual interest while maintaining legibility. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of retro charm reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or early computer interfaces. This retro aesthetic, combined with its strong legibility, makes it suitable for a range of applications, from headlines and logos to digital interfaces and playful branding. The font's bold presence and retro appeal evoke a sense of nostalgia and a playful, almost whimsical energy, suggesting a connection to a time of technological innovation and creative exploration.",
