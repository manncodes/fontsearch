    "detailed_description": "California is a handwritten script font that captures the casual charm of everyday writing. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and personality. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, the font's consistent baseline and well-defined letterforms maintain a sense of order and professionalism. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from personal branding and social media to packaging and editorial design. California's playful yet polished aesthetic evokes a sense of modern optimism and creative energy, making it a versatile choice for projects that seek to convey a friendly and approachable tone.",
