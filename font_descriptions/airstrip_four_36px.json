    "detailed_description": "Airstrip Four is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The rounded corners and slightly curved terminals soften the geometric rigidity, adding a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Airstrip Four a distinct personality, balancing a sense of technological advancement with a touch of warmth. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts that require a modern, futuristic feel. The font's cultural associations evoke a sense of retro-futurism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video games, while its clean lines and bold forms also resonate with contemporary digital design trends.",
