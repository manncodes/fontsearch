    "detailed_description": "Alexandra is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct 3D effect. Its construction relies on a grid-based system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The 3D illusion is achieved through a series of parallel lines that create a sense of depth and texture. This intricate detail adds visual interest and a touch of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold character and futuristic vibe make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as branding, posters, and digital interfaces. However, its intricate details might make it less suitable for very small sizes or complex layouts.",
