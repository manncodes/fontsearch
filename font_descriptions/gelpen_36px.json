    "detailed_description": "GelPen is a casual script font that captures the immediacy and expressiveness of handwritten text. Its flowing strokes and natural variations in thickness evoke the feeling of a pen gliding across paper. The font's organic construction, with its subtle curves and rounded terminals, creates a sense of warmth and approachability. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, the font maintains a degree of legibility, making it suitable for both short and longer blocks of text. The slight slant and uneven baseline add to its handwritten character, suggesting a personal touch and a sense of authenticity. GelPen's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from handwritten notes and personal correspondence to branding elements and social media graphics. Its informal yet legible nature makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to convey a friendly and approachable tone.",
