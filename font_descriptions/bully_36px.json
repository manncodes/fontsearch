    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, features a distinctive multi-layered design. Each letterform is composed of multiple concentric lines, creating a bold, almost three-dimensional effect. The sharp angles and precise lines contribute to a sense of rigidity and order, while the subtle variations in line thickness add a touch of visual interest. The overall character is both futuristic and retro, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics and contemporary digital design trends. Its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements, particularly in digital media where its sharp lines translate well on screens. However, its intricate structure might limit its readability in smaller sizes or extended text blocks. The font evokes a sense of power, technology, and a touch of retro nostalgia, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and grounded in history.",
