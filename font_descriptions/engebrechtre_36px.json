    "detailed_description": "Engebrechtre is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are constructed with clean, precise lines and angles, giving the font a sense of clarity and order. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric structure and humanist details creates a font that is both legible and visually engaging. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website copy to branding materials. Engebrechtre's contemporary aesthetic and versatile nature make it a strong choice for projects that require a clean, modern look with a touch of personality. The font's subtle curves and open forms evoke a sense of optimism and forward momentum, making it well-suited for brands that want to convey a sense of innovation and progress.",
