    "detailed_description": "This font's geometric construction is immediately apparent, with characters built from sharp angles and clean lines. The consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to a bold, uncluttered aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro-futuristic flair. The font's bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of strength and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and sharp angles suggest a sense of order and precision, while the slightly rounded corners add a touch of approachability.
