    "detailed_description": "Asenine is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of humanist warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, particularly in the uppercase letters. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall balance between geometric precision and subtle humanist details creates a font that is both professional and approachable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Asenine's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of efficiency and clarity, aligning it with the aesthetics of modern digital interfaces and branding. Its versatility allows it to be used effectively for everything from website design and mobile apps to corporate identity and editorial layouts.",
