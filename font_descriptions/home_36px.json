    "detailed_description": "This font is a flowing, elegant script with a strong calligraphic foundation. The characters are formed with graceful curves and delicate strokes, reminiscent of traditional penmanship. The ascenders and descenders are extended, creating a sense of verticality and rhythm. The overall impression is one of sophistication and timeless charm. The font's delicate strokes and flowing curves make it ideal for adding a touch of elegance to invitations, stationery, and other formal documents. However, its legibility can be compromised at smaller sizes, making it less suitable for body text or digital interfaces. The font's graceful curves and delicate strokes evoke a sense of romanticism and nostalgia, suggesting a bygone era of handwritten correspondence and elegant social gatherings.",
