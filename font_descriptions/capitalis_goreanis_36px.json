    "detailed_description": "This font draws inspiration from ancient Greek lettering, but with a contemporary twist. Its geometric construction is evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a bold and confident presence. The letterforms are simplified, with minimal ornamentation, emphasizing clarity and legibility. The high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The font's bold and angular nature evokes a sense of strength and authority, while its simplified forms suggest a modern and minimalist aesthetic. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a strong visual impact, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces.",
