    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a bold, geometric construction with sharp, angular terminals, creating a strong and assertive presence. The consistent stroke weight and lack of embellishment contribute to a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is both modern and timeless, evoking a sense of power and authority. Its sharp angles and bold forms suggest a sense of strength and determination, while the clean lines and consistent weight maintain a sense of order and control. This font is well-suited for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold presence and clear legibility make it effective for both print and digital media, particularly in large sizes where its geometric structure can be fully appreciated.",
