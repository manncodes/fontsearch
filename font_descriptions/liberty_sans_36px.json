    "detailed_description": "Liberty Sans exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. Its open counters and high x-height contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Liberty Sans a contemporary feel, suggesting a blend of digital modernity and classic design principles. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial layouts and user interfaces.",
