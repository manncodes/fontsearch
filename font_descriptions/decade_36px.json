    "detailed_description": "Decade is a bold, sans-serif typeface that embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its chunky letterforms, with their heavily distressed edges and uneven strokes, evoke a sense of grit and authenticity. The font's construction is decidedly geometric, with sharp corners and a consistent weight throughout, yet it's softened by the deliberate imperfections that give it a lived-in feel. This combination of geometric precision and organic irregularity creates a unique tension, making Decade both visually striking and surprisingly versatile. While its bold weight and distressed texture might suggest a limited range of applications, Decade's inherent energy and rebellious spirit make it ideal for projects that demand a strong visual impact, such as branding for edgy streetwear, music festivals, or independent publications. Its rough-hewn character speaks to a contemporary audience that values authenticity and embraces imperfection, making it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of rebellion and individuality.",
