    "detailed_description": "Jenriv is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built on a strong, consistent grid, with clean, crisp lines and open counters that ensure excellent legibility. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters, however, add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Jenriv versatile for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays and headlines, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for body text and smaller-scale applications. Jenriv's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modern sophistication and timeless elegance, suggesting a brand or project that is both innovative and grounded in quality.",
