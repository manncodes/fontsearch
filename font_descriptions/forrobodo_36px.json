    "detailed_description": "Forrobbodo is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost childlike aesthetic with a strong, geometric foundation. Its construction is based on simple, boxy shapes, with each letterform built from a series of straight lines and sharp angles. This creates a bold, graphic presence, reminiscent of early digital fonts or even hand-drawn lettering. However, the font's personality is softened by subtle details like the rounded terminals and the slight variation in stroke thickness, which add a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is a font that feels both playful and confident, making it suitable for a range of applications from branding and headlines to playful illustrations and digital interfaces. Its bold, graphic nature makes it particularly effective for capturing attention and conveying a sense of energy and dynamism, while its subtle humanizing details prevent it from feeling overly harsh or sterile.",
