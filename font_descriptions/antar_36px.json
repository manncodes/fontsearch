    "detailed_description": "Antar is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both retrofuturistic design and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are often squared off, adding to the font's bold and assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves are introduced in certain letters, such as the 'O' and 'C', adding a touch of humanity and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives Antar a unique personality, making it both futuristic and approachable. Its bold and confident appearance makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's association with science fiction and cyberpunk aesthetics makes it ideal for projects that evoke a sense of technological advancement and futuristic exploration.",
