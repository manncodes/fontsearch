    "detailed_description": "FT Anima is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built on a grid system, with clean lines and consistent proportions, giving the font a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes FT Anima a versatile font that can be used for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and screen. The overall character of FT Anima is confident and professional, yet approachable and friendly. It evokes a sense of modernism and sophistication, while remaining accessible and inviting. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the mid-century modern design movement, with its clean lines and geometric forms. However, its subtle humanist details and its versatility for digital applications make it feel equally relevant in the contemporary design landscape.",
