    "detailed_description": "Ananda is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that exudes a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are characterized by their wide, open counters and bold strokes, creating a sense of solidity and impact. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. The overall design is reminiscent of early 20th-century geometric sans-serif fonts, but with a contemporary edge. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. Ananda's bold personality makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications where a strong visual statement is desired. Its geometric construction and clean lines lend themselves well to digital interfaces, while its bold character evokes a sense of authority and confidence. The font's cultural associations range from the industrial aesthetic of the early 20th century to the bold, graphic style of contemporary digital culture.",
