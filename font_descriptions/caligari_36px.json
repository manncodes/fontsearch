    "detailed_description": "Caligari is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both Art Deco and early digital design. Its construction is based on simple, angular shapes, with each letterform composed of a limited number of geometric elements. This results in a strong, graphic presence, particularly noticeable in the sharp corners and bold strokes. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. While the overall aesthetic is undeniably modern, the subtle curves and rounded terminals in some letters, like 'O' and 'C', add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Caligari suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it ideal for conveying a sense of confidence, modernity, and even a touch of playful irreverence.",
