    "detailed_description": "Buka 36px is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that combines a strong, almost industrial aesthetic with a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its construction is based on a series of overlapping, angled lines that create a distinctive, three-dimensional effect. The letters are built with a consistent, almost mechanical precision, with sharp corners and clean lines. This geometric foundation gives the font a sense of order and structure, but the angled lines and slight distortions add a touch of dynamism and unpredictability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The overall effect is a font that is both eye-catching and readable, with a personality that is both playful and confident. Buka 36px is a font that evokes a sense of retro futurism, with its bold lines and angular shapes reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi design. It also has a strong connection to the world of street art and graffiti, with its bold, graphic style and playful distortions. This makes it a perfect choice for projects that want to convey a sense of energy, creativity, and rebellion. Buka 36px is a versatile font that can be used for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to posters and website design. Its bold, graphic style makes it ideal for headlines and logos, while its legibility makes it suitable for body text as well. However, its distinctive style may not be appropriate for all projects, and it should be used with care to avoid overwhelming the design.",
