    "detailed_description": "Archistico is a serif typeface that blends classic proportions with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional geometric principles, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the precise angles of terminals. However, the font avoids a rigid, cold aesthetic by incorporating subtle humanist details, such as the gentle curves of the lowercase 'a' and the slightly rounded terminals. This balance creates a typeface that is both legible and visually engaging, suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and editorial design. Its classic serif structure evokes a sense of tradition and authority, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of warmth and approachability. Archistico's versatility allows it to seamlessly transition from formal documents to playful branding, suggesting a timeless elegance that resonates with modern sensibilities.",
