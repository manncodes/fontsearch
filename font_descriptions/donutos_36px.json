    "detailed_description": "Donutos is a playful display typeface that draws inspiration from the exaggerated forms of cartoon lettering. Its rounded, bulbous shapes and exaggerated 3D effect create a sense of fun and whimsy. The font's construction is based on simple geometric forms, with each letter built from a series of curves and rounded corners. This simplicity contributes to its friendly and approachable character. The bold weight and generous stroke width ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes. The 3D effect adds a layer of depth and dimension, making the font visually engaging and eye-catching. Donutos is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a playful and attention-grabbing aesthetic is desired. Its retro-inspired design evokes a sense of nostalgia and fun, reminiscent of classic cartoons and comic books. The font's bold and playful nature makes it ideal for projects targeting a younger audience or those seeking a lighthearted and whimsical tone.",
