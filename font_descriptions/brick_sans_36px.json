    "detailed_description": "Brick Sans is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a bold, confident presence. Its construction is based on clean, rectangular forms, with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters enhance its clarity. The overall weight is heavy, creating a sense of solidity and impact. The font's design personality is both modern and timeless, drawing inspiration from mid-century geometric sans-serifs while maintaining a contemporary edge. Its bold character suggests strength, authority, and a sense of directness, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces. The font's sharp edges and geometric construction evoke a sense of precision and order, while its heavy weight adds a touch of boldness and confidence. Brick Sans is a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of applications, from large-scale signage to small-scale web design.",
