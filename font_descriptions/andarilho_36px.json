    "detailed_description": "Andarilho is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent stroke weights and precise angles, particularly in the uppercase letters. The lowercase, however, features slightly rounded terminals and a more organic flow, creating a balance between structure and approachability. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Andarilho a distinct personality, making it feel both contemporary and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Its clean lines and neutral character make it a versatile choice for both digital and print environments, while its subtle warmth suggests a friendly and approachable tone. Andarilho's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modern simplicity, reminiscent of mid-century design principles, but with a contemporary edge that feels fresh and relevant.",
