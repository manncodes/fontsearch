    "detailed_description": "Bolshevik, designed by KineticPlasma Fonts, is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct slant. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms, creating a strong, assertive presence. The letters are tightly spaced, further emphasizing the font's compact and powerful nature. The slant, while subtle, adds a dynamic element, suggesting movement and energy. This combination of geometric precision and dynamic slant gives Bolshevik a futuristic feel, reminiscent of science fiction imagery and cyberpunk aesthetics. The font's bold weight and high x-height ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces. Its assertive character and futuristic vibe make it ideal for projects that require a strong, modern, and slightly edgy aesthetic.",
