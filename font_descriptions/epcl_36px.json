    "detailed_description": "Epol is a playful yet legible sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from hand-drawn lettering. Its rounded forms and inconsistent stroke weights create a casual, approachable feel, reminiscent of handwritten notes or informal signage. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. While the overall aesthetic is relaxed, Epol maintains a sense of order through its consistent letterforms and balanced proportions. This balance allows it to be used for a variety of purposes, from playful branding to informative website copy. The font's hand-drawn origins evoke a sense of warmth and authenticity, suggesting a personal touch and a connection to the human element. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to communicate a friendly and approachable brand identity.",
