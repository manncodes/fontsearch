    "detailed_description": "ACL (3px) is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and approachability. ACL's overall character is both casual and confident, suggesting a sense of fun and creativity. It draws inspiration from classic calligraphic styles, but with a modern twist that feels fresh and contemporary. ACL is well-suited for branding, social media graphics, and other applications where a friendly and expressive tone is desired. Its casual yet polished aesthetic makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from playful invitations to bold headlines.",
