    "detailed_description": "Doubt is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a contemporary, minimalist aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and precise angles, creates a sense of order and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. While the overall impression is one of simplicity and efficiency, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in certain letterforms, add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance gives Doubt a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to user interfaces. The font's clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of innovation and progress, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch. Doubt's contemporary relevance is further emphasized by its inclusion of a comprehensive character set, including a variety of punctuation marks and symbols, making it suitable for a wide range of digital applications.",
