    "detailed_description": "Haricot is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from mid-century modern design. Its construction is based on simple, interlocking shapes, creating a distinctive visual language that is both playful and sophisticated. The rounded corners and open counters contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, while the strong, consistent stroke weight ensures excellent legibility even at small sizes. The font's bold character and playful nature make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a sense of energy and optimism is desired. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, while its clean lines and modern construction ensure its relevance in contemporary design. Haricot's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from playful packaging to bold website headers, adding a touch of personality and visual interest to any project.",
