    "detailed_description": "Lugosi is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the graphic impact of vintage movie posters and the raw energy of punk rock aesthetics. Its chunky, geometric letterforms are built with a strong emphasis on verticality, creating a sense of power and presence. The sharp, angular terminals and heavy stroke weights contribute to a sense of aggression and intensity, while the uneven, distressed texture adds a layer of grit and authenticity. This combination of bold geometry and rough-hewn texture gives Lugosi a distinct personality, making it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of rebellion or raw energy. Its bold, impactful nature makes it well-suited for headlines, posters, and branding projects that require a strong visual presence. However, its distressed texture may limit its readability in smaller sizes or extended text blocks, making it more appropriate for short bursts of text or display applications. Lugosi's raw, unpolished aesthetic evokes a sense of underground culture and rebellious spirit, reminiscent of the punk rock movement and the gritty aesthetic of vintage horror films. It's a font that speaks to a sense of individuality and nonconformity, making it a powerful tool for projects that aim to stand out from the crowd.",
