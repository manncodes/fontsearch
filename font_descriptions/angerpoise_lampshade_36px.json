    "detailed_description": "Angerpoise Lampshade is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly stylized, with a strong emphasis on verticality and a distinct lack of curves. This creates a sense of rigidity and power, reminiscent of early digital typography and the aesthetics of cyberpunk culture. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold, assertive character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces that require a strong visual impact. However, its lack of stylistic variation and limited character set may limit its use in longer-form content or projects requiring a more nuanced visual language.",
