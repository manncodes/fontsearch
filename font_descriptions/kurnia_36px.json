    "detailed_description": "Kurnia is a flowing script typeface that embodies a classic elegance with a touch of contemporary flair. Its graceful curves and fluid strokes are reminiscent of traditional calligraphy, yet the font's overall structure is balanced and legible, making it suitable for both formal and informal applications. The ascenders and descenders are well-proportioned, creating a sense of rhythm and visual interest. The letterforms are carefully crafted, with subtle variations in stroke weight and curvature that add depth and character. The font's overall personality is one of sophistication and charm, with a hint of playfulness. It evokes a sense of warmth and approachability, making it ideal for branding, invitations, and other projects that require a touch of personality. While its traditional roots are evident, Kurnia's clean lines and modern feel make it equally well-suited for digital applications, such as website headers, social media graphics, and mobile interfaces.",
