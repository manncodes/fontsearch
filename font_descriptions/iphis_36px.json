    "detailed_description": "Ipahs is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp angles and strong, vertical strokes, creating a sense of solidity and power. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal negative space, further emphasizing their weight and presence. The overall effect is one of starkness and directness, with a hint of retrofuturism. The font's bold, angular forms and lack of serifs lend it a sense of immediacy and impact, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and other applications where a strong visual statement is desired. However, its lack of subtlety and potential for legibility issues at smaller sizes might limit its use in body text or complex layouts. Ipahs evokes a sense of industrial strength and futuristic technology, reminiscent of science fiction films and cyberpunk aesthetics. Its bold, angular forms suggest a sense of power and control, while its starkness and lack of ornamentation create a sense of coldness and detachment. This combination of qualities makes Ipahs a powerful tool for conveying a sense of authority, innovation, and even danger.",
