    "detailed_description": "Boncu Sketches is a playful display font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, organic forms are reminiscent of a child's scribbles, with exaggerated curves and uneven strokes. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall construction is loose and informal, the consistent weight and well-defined terminals give it a sense of control. This balance between spontaneity and structure makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from playful branding to eye-catching headlines. The font's whimsical nature evokes a sense of fun and lightheartedness, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to tap into the growing trend of hand-drawn aesthetics, while its cultural associations range from childhood nostalgia to the DIY spirit of digital culture.",
