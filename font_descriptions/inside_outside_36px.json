    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its double-line construction, creating a bold, outlined effect. Each letterform is composed of two parallel lines, with a consistent gap between them, resulting in a clean, geometric aesthetic. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions contribute to a friendly, approachable feel, while the overall structure maintains a sense of clarity and professionalism. This combination makes it suitable for a range of applications, from playful headlines to informative signage, where its bold presence and clear legibility are assets. The double-line effect evokes a sense of depth and dimensionality, suggesting a playful, almost cartoonish quality, while the overall structure maintains a sense of order and control, hinting at a sense of structure and reliability. This duality makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of playful energy and professional polish.",
