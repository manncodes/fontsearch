    "detailed_description": "Lestat is a display typeface that blends gothic influences with a distinctly modern edge. Its bold, angular strokes and sharp terminals create a sense of drama and intensity, reminiscent of classic horror fonts. However, the font's unique construction, featuring internal lines that break up the letterforms, adds a layer of complexity and visual interest that feels distinctly contemporary. This interplay of traditional and modern elements gives Lestat a unique personality, making it suitable for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of the unexpected. While its bold weight and intricate details make it ideal for headlines and branding elements, its legibility is somewhat compromised at smaller sizes, limiting its use for extended body text. Lestat's gothic aesthetic evokes a sense of mystery and intrigue, suggesting themes of darkness, power, and the supernatural. Its contemporary twist, however, prevents it from feeling overly traditional or clich\u00e9d, making it a compelling choice for projects that aim to push boundaries and create a memorable visual experience.",
