    "detailed_description": "Delarge Marker Pen embodies the spirit of casual, expressive handwriting. Its irregular letterforms, with their varying stroke widths and playful curves, evoke the immediacy of a marker pen on paper. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes, while the uneven baseline adds a touch of whimsy. This combination of technical clarity and expressive character makes it ideal for informal projects, particularly those seeking a youthful, energetic vibe. The font's cultural associations range from the DIY aesthetic of zines and street art to the playful energy of social media graphics. Its versatility allows it to be used for everything from handwritten notes and playful logos to bold headlines and eye-catching packaging.",
