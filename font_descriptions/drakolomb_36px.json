    "detailed_description": "Drakolomb is a sans-serif typeface that balances a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its clean lines and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Drakolomb versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its clean, modern aesthetic evokes a sense of professionalism and confidence, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile. Drakolomb's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of clarity, approachability, and sophistication.",
