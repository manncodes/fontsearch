    "detailed_description": "This font is a playful and expressive script typeface that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its organic forms and uneven strokes create a sense of spontaneity and personality. The ascenders and descenders are exaggerated, adding to the dynamic feel, while the rounded terminals soften the overall impression. The font's casual character makes it ideal for informal projects, such as social media graphics, handwritten notes, or playful branding. It evokes a sense of youthful energy and creativity, reminiscent of childhood doodles and personal expression. While its legibility is best at larger sizes, it can be used effectively for short text blocks or headlines, adding a touch of whimsy and personality to any design.",
