    "detailed_description": "Anvyl 36px is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on clean, angular lines and sharp corners, reminiscent of early digital displays and 1980s video game graphics. The letterforms are tightly spaced, creating a compact and dense visual impact. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and assertive character make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual presence is desired. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and playful energy, while its geometric construction lends a sense of order and clarity. Anvyl 36px is a versatile typeface that can be used to create a range of visual styles, from retro-inspired designs to modern and minimalist aesthetics.",
