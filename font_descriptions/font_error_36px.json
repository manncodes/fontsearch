    "detailed_description": "Font Error is a playful and slightly quirky sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights, giving it a modern and crisp appearance. However, the rounded terminals and slightly asymmetrical letterforms, particularly in lowercase characters like 'a' and 'g', inject a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale display and smaller body text. The overall character of Font Error is one of playful confidence, suggesting a brand that is both modern and approachable. It evokes a sense of digital-native design, with its clean lines and bold forms, but also carries a hint of retro charm, reminiscent of early computer interfaces. This duality makes it versatile for a range of applications, from website headers and app interfaces to branding materials and editorial design. While its geometric construction lends itself well to digital environments, its subtle humanist touches ensure that it remains readable and engaging in print.",
