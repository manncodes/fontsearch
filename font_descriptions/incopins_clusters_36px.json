    "detailed_description": "This font is a striking example of geometric sans-serif design, built upon a grid-based structure with a strong emphasis on clean lines and precise angles. The letterforms are constructed with a double-stroke technique, creating a bold and graphic presence. The consistent width of the strokes and the sharp, unrounded terminals contribute to a sense of rigidity and order. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. It evokes a sense of technological advancement and streamlined efficiency, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. This font is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold and modern statement is desired. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it effective for both large-scale displays and smaller screen applications. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to a period of technological optimism and design innovation, while its contemporary relevance stems from its ability to convey a sense of futuristic energy and digital sophistication.",
