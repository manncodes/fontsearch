    "detailed_description": "Days is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost-circular shapes of the lowercase letters, particularly 'o' and 'a'. The uppercase letters, however, exhibit a subtle humanist influence, with slightly rounded terminals and a slight variation in stroke thickness, adding a touch of approachability to the otherwise rigid structure. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth creates a font that feels both contemporary and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed signage. Its bold weight and strong character make it ideal for conveying a sense of confidence and authority, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Days evokes a sense of optimism and progress, reminiscent of the clean lines and bold designs of the mid-century modern era, yet its adaptability makes it feel perfectly at home in the digital landscape of today.",
