    "detailed_description": "Expressway is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of playful energy. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp angles of letterforms, creates a sense of order and precision. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'c'. This balance between geometric structure and organic detail gives Expressway a unique personality, making it both visually appealing and highly legible. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces and branding applications. Its versatility extends to print, where it can be used for headlines, body text, and even display purposes. Expressway's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, making it a fitting choice for projects that aim to communicate a modern and dynamic brand identity.",
