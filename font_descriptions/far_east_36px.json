    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a striking blend of geometric precision and organic expressiveness. Its construction is rooted in a strong, almost architectural, framework, with characters built from clean, angular strokes. However, the execution is far from rigid. The strokes are often slightly uneven, with subtle variations in thickness and direction, lending a hand-drawn quality that softens the overall impression. This interplay between structure and spontaneity creates a unique character, simultaneously modern and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. Its bold, confident presence suggests authority and sophistication, while the subtle human touch adds a layer of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and even display applications where a strong visual impact is desired.",
