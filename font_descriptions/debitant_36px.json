    "detailed_description": "Debitant is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a futuristic aesthetic with a strong emphasis on structure and clarity. Its construction is based on a series of parallel lines, creating a distinct three-dimensional effect. The letters are composed of bold, clean strokes with sharp corners and minimal curves, resulting in a highly legible and impactful visual. This geometric foundation gives Debitant a sense of order and precision, evoking a sense of technological advancement and futuristic design. The font's bold weight and consistent stroke width contribute to its assertive and confident personality, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual presence is desired. However, the sharp angles and lack of organic curves can make it feel somewhat cold or impersonal in extended text. Debitant's bold and futuristic aesthetic makes it particularly well-suited for science fiction, gaming, and technology-related projects. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it effective for headlines, logos, and interface elements. However, its lack of warmth and limited character variation may limit its use in longer-form content or applications requiring a more nuanced visual style.",
