    "detailed_description": "Headache is a display typeface that embraces a playful, almost whimsical, approach to letterforms. Its construction is a blend of traditional calligraphic influences and a contemporary, almost cartoonish, exaggeration. The letters are characterized by pronounced curves, exaggerated serifs, and a distinct lack of uniformity. This creates a sense of movement and energy, as if the letters are dancing across the page. The font's personality is both charming and slightly mischievous, with a touch of gothic flair. It's a font that demands attention, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its intricate details and uneven spacing might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes. Headache's cultural resonance lies in its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia for vintage typography, while simultaneously feeling fresh and modern. It's a font that speaks to a playful and creative spirit, suggesting a sense of fun and individuality.",
