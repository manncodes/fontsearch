    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction, exudes a strong, confident personality. The letterforms are built on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The sharp terminals and consistent stroke weights contribute to a sense of order and clarity. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. While the overall impression is one of strength and authority, the slightly rounded corners of the terminals and the subtle curves in some letterforms, like the 'a' and 'g', add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and headlines to editorial and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and clear readability make it ideal for conveying a message of power and confidence, while its subtle humanism ensures it remains engaging and approachable.",
