    "detailed_description": "La Negrita is a playful and expressive font that utilizes a bold, extruded design to create a sense of depth and dimension. The rounded forms and exaggerated curves give the font a friendly and approachable feel, while the consistent, slightly angled extrusion adds a touch of dynamism. The generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's playful nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements that require a touch of whimsy and personality. Its bold presence and playful character evoke a sense of fun and energy, making it suitable for projects targeting a younger audience or those seeking a lighthearted and engaging aesthetic. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from playful children's books to bold and eye-catching website designs.",
