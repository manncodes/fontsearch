    "detailed_description": "Bebas Neue is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, geometric construction and high x-height. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on verticality, resulting in a tall, narrow appearance. The strokes are consistently thick, with sharp, angular terminals that contribute to the font's assertive and confident personality. The open counters and generous spacing between letters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric precision and bold presence makes Bebas Neue a powerful choice for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its contemporary aesthetic, reminiscent of early digital typography, lends itself well to modern design trends, while its versatility allows it to be used across a range of applications, from bold statements to subtle accents.",
