    "detailed_description": "Boldace Brush is a script font that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, calligraphic strokes mimic the texture of a brush, creating a dynamic and expressive feel. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven baseline adds a touch of casual authenticity. The overall character is playful and energetic, suggesting a sense of spontaneity and creativity. Its brush-like quality evokes a sense of hand-crafted artistry, making it ideal for projects that require a personal touch. Boldace Brush is well-suited for branding, packaging, and digital media, particularly in situations where a casual, expressive aesthetic is desired. Its versatility allows it to be used for headlines, logos, and even body text, adding a unique and engaging visual element to any design.",
