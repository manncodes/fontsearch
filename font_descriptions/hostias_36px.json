    "detailed_description": "Hostias is a playful display typeface that embraces a hand-drawn aesthetic. Its rounded forms and irregular strokes evoke a sense of casual energy, reminiscent of marker or brush lettering. The font's bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility, even at larger sizes. While the overall construction is organic and free-flowing, there's a deliberate balance in the letterforms, preventing them from becoming overly whimsical. This balance allows Hostias to be used for a variety of applications, from eye-catching headlines to playful branding elements. Its informal character and bold presence make it particularly well-suited for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of fun. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to contemporary digital culture, where hand-drawn aesthetics are often used to convey authenticity and informality.",
