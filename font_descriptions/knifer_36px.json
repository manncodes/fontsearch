    "detailed_description": "Kaffee is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, minimalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, contributing to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of clean, modern simplicity, with a touch of industrial edge. This font's bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its minimalist design evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, aligning with contemporary trends in design and technology. However, its starkness can also feel cold or impersonal in certain contexts, making it less suitable for projects requiring warmth or a more traditional feel.",
