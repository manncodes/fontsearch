    "detailed_description": "Desonance is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise, almost mathematical proportions, with each letterform built from a series of straight lines and sharp angles. The x-height is relatively high, and the counters are open and generous, contributing to its bold and assertive presence. The terminals are cut sharply, adding to the overall sense of angularity and rigidity. While the design is undeniably modern, it also draws inspiration from the geometric sans-serifs of the early 20th century, particularly those associated with the Bauhaus movement. This historical connection gives Desonance a sense of timeless elegance, despite its contemporary edge. The font's bold and assertive nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. Its geometric construction and sharp angles lend themselves well to digital interfaces and screen-based media, while its historical roots add a touch of sophistication and gravitas. Desonance evokes a sense of power, authority, and clarity, making it suitable for projects that require a strong and confident visual identity.",
