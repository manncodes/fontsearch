    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, with each letterform built from sharp angles and distinct, almost pixelated edges. The heavy weight and exaggerated stroke widths create a sense of solidity and power, while the consistent use of sharp terminals adds a touch of aggression. The overall effect is a font that feels both futuristic and retro, reminiscent of early video game graphics or cyberpunk aesthetics. While the bold design makes it highly legible at larger sizes, its intricate details and sharp angles might become less clear at smaller point sizes, limiting its use in fine print or delicate layouts. However, its strong personality and unique visual impact make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, or any design that demands attention and a sense of futuristic edge.",
