    "detailed_description": "Break is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, futuristic aesthetic. Its construction relies on a grid-based system, resulting in clean, angular letterforms with sharp terminals and consistent stroke weights. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is bold and assertive, with a sense of technological precision. Its design evokes the minimalist aesthetic of early computer interfaces and the cyberpunk imagery of the 1980s, suggesting a future where technology and design are seamlessly intertwined. Break's sharp angles and geometric forms create a sense of order and control, while its clean lines and consistent weight convey a sense of efficiency and functionality. This makes it well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and graphic design projects that require a strong, modern aesthetic. However, its starkness might not be suitable for all applications, particularly those requiring a more approachable or traditional feel.",
