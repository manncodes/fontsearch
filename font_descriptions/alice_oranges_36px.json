    "detailed_description": "Alice Oranges is a playful script font that captures the essence of handwritten text. Its organic forms and inconsistent stroke weights create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The ascenders and descenders are exaggerated, adding to the dynamic and expressive nature of the typeface. While the overall construction is loose and informal, the letters maintain a clear legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text. The font's casual charm evokes a sense of warmth and approachability, making it ideal for projects that require a personal touch. Its versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and handwritten notes.",
