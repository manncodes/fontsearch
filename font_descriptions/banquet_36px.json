    "detailed_description": "Banquet PX is a bold, sans-serif typeface that utilizes a distinct 3D extrusion effect to create a sense of depth and dimension. The geometric construction of the letterforms, with their sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, contributes to a clean and modern aesthetic. The extrusion effect, however, adds a playful and almost cartoonish element, creating a visual tension between the geometric precision and the exaggerated depth. This tension is further emphasized by the font's high x-height and open counters, which ensure strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Banquet PX is confident and energetic, suggesting a sense of movement and dynamism. Its playful nature makes it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a bold and attention-grabbing presence. However, its geometric construction and strong legibility also make it suitable for more functional applications, such as website design or user interface elements. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the 1980s and 1990s, evoking a sense of retrofuturism and the early days of computer graphics. Its bold and playful nature also aligns with contemporary trends in digital design, where bold visuals and playful aesthetics are increasingly popular.",
