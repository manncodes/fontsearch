    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a striking contrast between its bold, geometric construction and its subtly humanist details. The strong, vertical strokes and sharp terminals create a sense of confidence and authority, reminiscent of classic sans-serif designs. However, the slightly rounded corners and open counters introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes it versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to editorial design. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital media. Its contemporary feel, with a hint of retro influence, suggests a brand that is both forward-thinking and grounded in tradition.",
