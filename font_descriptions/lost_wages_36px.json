    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its double-stroke construction, creating a bold, graphic presence. Each letterform is composed of two parallel lines, with a consistent gap between them, resulting in a clean, geometric aesthetic. The sharp terminals and open counters contribute to a sense of clarity and legibility, even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro charm reminiscent of early digital typography. This font's bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro aesthetic can be used to evoke a sense of nostalgia or to create a playful, modern feel. However, its limited character set and lack of stylistic alternates may limit its versatility for extended text.",
