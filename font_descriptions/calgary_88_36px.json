    "detailed_description": "Calgary 88 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are wide and squat, with a high x-height and open counters that contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a touch of aggression to the overall character. The font's bold weight and assertive forms create a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its geometric construction and clean lines also lend it a modern, contemporary feel, making it appropriate for digital interfaces and other modern design contexts. However, its bold weight and angularity might make it less suitable for extended body text, where a more neutral and less aggressive typeface might be preferred.",
