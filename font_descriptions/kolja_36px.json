    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric sans-serif design, drawing inspiration from the stark clarity of early 20th-century modernism. Its construction is strictly geometric, with each letterform built from precise angles and straight lines. The x-height is high, creating a sense of openness and legibility, while the tight letter spacing emphasizes the font's strong, assertive character. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's sense of power and authority. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, a font that commands attention without being overly aggressive. Its clean lines and bold presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's geometric construction and bold weight evoke a sense of order and control, suggesting a brand that is confident, reliable, and forward-thinking. It's a font that feels both timeless and contemporary, capable of conveying a sense of authority and modernity.",
