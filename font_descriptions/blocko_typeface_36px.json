    "detailed_description": "Blocko is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, bold presence. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, contributing to excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slight curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', prevent it from feeling overly cold or robotic. Blocko's bold weight and confident stance make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its geometric nature lends itself to modern, minimalist designs, while its subtle humanist touches ensure a degree of approachability. The font evokes a sense of clarity, precision, and authority, reminiscent of the bold, graphic styles of the mid-20th century. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of confidence and modernity, making it suitable for a wide range of digital and print applications.",
