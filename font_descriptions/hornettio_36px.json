    "detailed_description": "Hornettio is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp angles and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of individual squares, creating a bold and graphic presence. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is bold and confident, with a playful edge. It evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early video game graphics and 8-bit aesthetics. This makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of nostalgia. Hornettio's pixelated nature lends itself well to digital applications, particularly in web design, mobile interfaces, and game development. It can also be used effectively in print for headlines, posters, and branding elements, adding a unique and eye-catching touch.",
