    "detailed_description": "Bebel (36px) is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its clean lines, open counters, and consistent stroke weights. The font's construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The lowercase letters, particularly 'a', 'e', and 'o', exhibit a subtle humanist touch with rounded terminals, adding a touch of warmth to the otherwise geometric design. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a font that is both modern and approachable. Bebel's high x-height and generous spacing ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's clean and contemporary aesthetic evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and innovation, aligning well with modern design trends. Its versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from website headers and mobile app interfaces to corporate branding and editorial layouts.",
