    "detailed_description": "The font's geometric construction is immediately apparent, with each letterform built from sharp angles and straight lines. This creates a bold, assertive presence, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. The consistent use of sharp corners and a lack of curves gives the font a distinct, almost robotic feel, while the generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and solid forms make it ideal for headlines and display applications, where its strong personality can command attention. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of personal computing and video games, while its clean lines and sharp edges also suggest a modern, minimalist sensibility. This duality makes it suitable for projects that want to blend retro charm with contemporary edge.",
