    "detailed_description": "Impressed Metal is a display typeface that captures the essence of industrial lettering, evoking a sense of strength and authenticity. Its defining characteristic is the bold, extruded outline, reminiscent of metal lettering pressed into a surface. This effect is achieved through a double-stroke construction, where the outer stroke is slightly offset from the inner, creating a subtle three-dimensional illusion. The letterforms themselves are based on a geometric structure, with clean lines and sharp corners, further reinforcing the industrial aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. While its industrial origins are clear, Impressed Metal also possesses a playful quality, with the slight offset of the strokes adding a touch of dynamism and energy. This makes it suitable for projects that require a bold statement without being overly serious. The font's cultural associations range from vintage signage and industrial design to contemporary street art and urban aesthetics, making it a versatile choice for projects that seek to convey a sense of authenticity and grit.",
