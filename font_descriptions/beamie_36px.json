    "detailed_description": "Beamie 36px is a bold, geometric sans-serif font built entirely from stacked, parallel lines. This construction creates a distinctive visual texture, reminiscent of 1970s graphic design and the era's fascination with geometric patterns. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for display applications. The rounded terminals and slightly curved letterforms add a touch of approachability, softening the stark geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and organic curves gives Beamie 36px a playful and retro-futuristic personality, evoking a sense of optimism and energy. Its bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that seek a strong visual impact with a touch of vintage charm. The font's unique construction and bold presence make it a standout choice for projects that aim to capture the spirit of a bygone era while remaining relevant in contemporary design.",
