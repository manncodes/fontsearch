    "detailed_description": "DaggerSquare is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct slant, reminiscent of both retrofuturistic design and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms, with a strong emphasis on verticality. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its clear legibility, while the open counters and consistent stroke weight enhance its readability even at smaller sizes. The slant, while pronounced, is carefully controlled, ensuring that the letters remain easily recognizable and maintain a sense of balance. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanization gives DaggerSquare a confident yet approachable personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital signage. Its strong visual presence and contemporary feel evoke a sense of dynamism and energy, suggesting a forward-thinking and innovative spirit.",
