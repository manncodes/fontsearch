    "detailed_description": "This font is a minimalist masterpiece, defined by its stark simplicity and geometric construction. Each letterform is composed of two straight lines meeting at a sharp angle, creating a sense of angularity and precision. The consistent stroke weight and lack of embellishments contribute to a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. This makes it ideal for digital interfaces, where clarity is paramount. The sharp angles and geometric structure evoke a sense of modernity and efficiency, suggesting a digital-native design. However, the font's simplicity also lends itself to a timeless quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and web interfaces.",
