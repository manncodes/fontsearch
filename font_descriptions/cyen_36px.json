    "detailed_description": "Cyen is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a balanced approach to legibility and personality. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent stroke widths and precise angles, provides a clean and modern aesthetic. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through subtle humanist touches, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g'. This combination of geometric structure and humanist detail creates a typeface that is both professional and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website copy to branding materials. Cyen's overall character is one of confident clarity, suggesting a sense of order and efficiency. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey both professionalism and a touch of warmth, making it a versatile choice for a variety of projects. The font's cultural associations lean towards a modern, minimalist aesthetic, reminiscent of the clean lines and functional design of mid-century modernism.",
