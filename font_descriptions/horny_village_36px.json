    "detailed_description": "Horny Village is a playful display typeface that blends rounded, cartoonish forms with a touch of geometric structure. The letters are characterized by their generous curves, open counters, and slightly exaggerated proportions, creating a sense of friendly informality. The overall construction is simple and direct, with a focus on clear legibility even at larger sizes. The font's rounded terminals and playful curves evoke a sense of warmth and approachability, making it ideal for projects that require a lighthearted and engaging tone. While its bold forms and playful nature make it suitable for headlines and branding elements, its legibility and versatility extend to digital interfaces and playful illustrations. The font's overall character suggests a sense of youthful energy and optimism, reminiscent of vintage cartoon graphics and contemporary digital culture.",
