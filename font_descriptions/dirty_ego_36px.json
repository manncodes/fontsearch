    "detailed_description": "\u201cDirty Ego\u201d is a display typeface that embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by bold, angular strokes with pronounced serifs that often appear jagged or broken. This deliberate imperfection creates a sense of urgency and grit, reminiscent of hand-painted lettering or distressed signage. The font's x-height is relatively low, contributing to its compressed and aggressive feel. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, further emphasizing its raw energy. While the overall design is decidedly bold, subtle variations in stroke weight and the occasional use of rounded terminals add a touch of human touch, preventing the font from feeling overly mechanical. This balance between roughness and subtle refinement makes \u201cDirty Ego\u201d suitable for projects that demand a strong visual impact, such as punk rock posters, street art graphics, or edgy branding. Its raw energy and rebellious spirit evoke a sense of underground culture, rebellion, and authenticity, making it a powerful tool for conveying a message of defiance and individuality.",
