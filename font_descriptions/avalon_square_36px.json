    "detailed_description": "Avalon Square embodies a playful yet sophisticated approach to typography. Its defining characteristic is the bold, double-lined construction, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. Each letterform is meticulously crafted within a square grid, resulting in a geometrically precise and balanced aesthetic. The sharp corners and clean lines contribute to a modern and assertive feel, while the subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of visual interest. This combination of geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes Avalon Square suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to playful digital interfaces and editorial designs. Its strong visual presence and clear legibility make it ideal for capturing attention and conveying a sense of confidence and modernity.",
