    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and strong, consistent stroke weights, exudes a sense of confident authority. The letterforms are clearly defined, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanist details makes it versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's bold presence and clear readability suggest a sense of trustworthiness and professionalism, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it feel approachable and inviting. It evokes a sense of modern sophistication, drawing inspiration from classic sans-serif designs while maintaining a contemporary edge.",
