    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms and sharp, angular terminals, embodies a distinct sense of futuristic minimalism. The construction is primarily geometric, with each letterform built from simple, interlocking shapes. This creates a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of architectural blueprints or technical diagrams. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall character is bold and assertive, yet the clean lines and consistent weight distribution maintain a sense of clarity and professionalism. The font's starkness and geometric nature evoke a sense of technological advancement and futuristic design, reminiscent of science fiction films and cyberpunk aesthetics. Its bold, confident presence makes it ideal for branding, headlines, and digital interfaces that require a strong visual impact and a sense of modern sophistication.",
