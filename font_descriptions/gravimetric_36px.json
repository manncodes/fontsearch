    "detailed_description": "This font, with its stark geometric construction and sharp, unornamented terminals, embodies a sense of stark minimalism. The letterforms are built from a series of straight lines and right angles, creating a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to a sense of uniformity and order. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. This font's starkness evokes a sense of objectivity and precision, making it suitable for applications where clarity and directness are paramount. It suggests a digital-native design aesthetic, with its clean lines and lack of ornamentation, and could be used effectively in user interfaces, data visualizations, or minimalist branding. However, its lack of warmth or personality might limit its use in more expressive or emotional contexts.",
