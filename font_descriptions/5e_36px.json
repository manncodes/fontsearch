    "detailed_description": "SE is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its stark, angular forms and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are constructed with precise, almost mechanical precision, resulting in a clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The sharp terminals and lack of serifs lend a modern and minimalist feel, evoking a sense of efficiency and clarity. While the overall impression is one of starkness and objectivity, subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slightly rounded corners of the lowercase 'a' and 'e', introduce a touch of humanity and prevent the font from feeling overly cold. SE's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces and mobile apps to branding and editorial design. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic resonate with contemporary digital culture, while its strong legibility and neutral character make it suitable for both large and small-scale projects.",
