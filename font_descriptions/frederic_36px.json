    "detailed_description": "Frederic is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a balanced blend of geometric precision and humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a clear grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines of the letterforms. The overall structure is geometric, with a strong emphasis on verticality and a consistent stroke weight. However, the typeface avoids feeling overly rigid through subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g'. This combination of geometric structure and humanist touch creates a typeface that is both legible and approachable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Frederic's confident yet friendly personality makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces, where it can convey professionalism without feeling cold or sterile. Its versatility allows it to adapt to various sizes and media, from large-scale headlines to small-scale website text, while maintaining its distinct character.",
