    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and sharp, angular terminals, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise appearance that evokes the precision of early computer graphics and the minimalist design of the 1980s. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text. While the overall impression is one of starkness and modernity, the subtle curves in the terminals and the slight variations in stroke weight add a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle organic elements makes it versatile for a range of applications, from tech-focused branding to editorial design, where it can inject a sense of futuristic optimism and a touch of playful retro charm.",
