    "detailed_description": "Craig is a playful display font that embraces a hand-drawn aesthetic with a touch of whimsy. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by rounded curves and exaggerated strokes, create a sense of spontaneity and energy. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at larger sizes. While the overall construction is organic and free-flowing, subtle details like the star-shaped accents on certain letters add a touch of charm and personality. Craig's informal character makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as children's books, branding for creative businesses, or playful social media graphics. Its bold and expressive nature allows it to stand out in digital environments, adding a touch of personality to websites, posters, and even animated graphics.",
