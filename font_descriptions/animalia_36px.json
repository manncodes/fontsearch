    "detailed_description": "Font Animalia, designed by Veronique, is a playful and expressive typeface that utilizes a double-outline construction to create a sense of depth and dimension. The letterforms are based on a geometric structure, with clean lines and sharp corners, but they are softened by the subtle curves and rounded terminals. This combination of geometric precision and organic detail gives the font a unique character, balancing a sense of modernity with a touch of whimsy. The double outline, while adding visual interest, also contributes to the font's legibility, ensuring that it remains clear and readable even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a font that is both visually striking and functionally effective, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from playful branding to bold headlines. The double outline, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, evokes a sense of handcrafted quality, adding a touch of personality and warmth to the design. This, combined with the font's geometric foundation, creates a unique balance between traditional and contemporary aesthetics, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of both.",
