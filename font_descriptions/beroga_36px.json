    "detailed_description": "Beroga is a bold, italic typeface that combines a playful, almost cartoonish energy with a surprisingly legible structure. Its rounded, geometric forms are reminiscent of early digital fonts, but the subtle curves and angled terminals give it a more contemporary feel. The generous x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The italic angle is pronounced, adding a dynamic and energetic quality to the font. While its playful nature might suggest a casual application, Beroga's strong structure and clear legibility make it suitable for a wider range of projects, from branding and packaging to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold, expressive character evokes a sense of fun and energy, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a modern, digital aesthetic.",
