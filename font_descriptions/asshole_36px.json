    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, blocky forms and pronounced 3D extrusion, embodies a classic retro aesthetic. The geometric construction of the letters, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of solidity and strength. The exaggerated depth of the extrusion adds a playful dimension, suggesting movement and dynamism. The overall effect is one of confident retro charm, reminiscent of 1980s arcade games and sci-fi movie posters. While the font's bold nature makes it ideal for headlines and display purposes, its legibility is somewhat compromised at smaller sizes due to the thick strokes and limited contrast. However, its strong personality and nostalgic appeal make it a compelling choice for projects seeking a vintage, eye-catching feel.",
