    "detailed_description": "Bridge 35PX is a bold, playful display typeface that draws inspiration from vintage signage and 3D graphics. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated 3D extrusion, which gives each letter a sense of depth and volume. The construction is geometric, with clean lines and sharp corners, but the slight rounding of the terminals softens the overall impression. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that is both eye-catching and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other display applications. The font's retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and fun, reminiscent of classic arcade games and 1980s pop culture. Its playful personality makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of whimsy and energy, while its bold presence ensures that it will always stand out.",
