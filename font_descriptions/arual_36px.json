    "detailed_description": "Arual is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail is further emphasized by the font's high x-height and open counters, which contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. Arual's design evokes a sense of simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial and interface design. Its clean lines and contemporary feel suggest a digital-native design sensibility, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for projects that require a touch of human connection.",
