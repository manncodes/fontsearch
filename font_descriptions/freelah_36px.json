    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric construction, with characters built from precise angles and straight lines. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall proportions are balanced, with a slight emphasis on the ascenders and descenders, adding a touch of dynamism to the otherwise rigid structure. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanist details creates a font that is both modern and approachable. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's bold, confident character evokes a sense of authority and professionalism, while its geometric nature suggests a sense of order and efficiency. It resonates with contemporary design trends that favor clean lines and minimalist aesthetics, while also referencing the geometric sans-serif fonts of the mid-20th century.",
