    "detailed_description": "Colonial Havana is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle nods to classic geometric designs. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, unornamented terminals. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall proportions are balanced and harmonious, creating a sense of order and clarity. While the font's geometric foundation provides a sense of structure and formality, the slightly rounded corners of the terminals and the subtle variations in letterforms, such as the 'a' and 'g', inject a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Colonial Havana versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and modern feel resonate with contemporary design trends, while its subtle nods to classic geometric styles provide a sense of timelessness and sophistication. The font's overall character is one of confidence and clarity, suggesting professionalism and a commitment to quality.",
