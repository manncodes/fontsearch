    "detailed_description": "Lera is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its rounded forms and uneven strokes create a sense of casual informality, reminiscent of a quick note scribbled on paper. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly irregular baseline adds to its hand-drawn charm, while the consistent weight and smooth curves contribute to its overall readability. Lera's personality is both friendly and energetic, suggesting a sense of youthful optimism and creative expression. It evokes a sense of personal connection, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of warmth and authenticity. Its versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and website design. Lera's informal yet legible nature makes it a perfect choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of approachability and creativity.",
