    "detailed_description": "Gelatin PX is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its defining characteristic is the bold, extruded 3D effect, achieved through multiple outlines that create a sense of depth and dimension. This technique, reminiscent of early computer graphics and 1980s video game aesthetics, adds a retro-futuristic feel to the font. The letterforms themselves are based on a geometric construction, with clean lines and sharp corners, contributing to a sense of solidity and structure. However, the slight rounding of the terminals and the overall proportions, with a moderate x-height and open counters, prevent the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Gelatin PX versatile for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful branding and digital interfaces. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for a time when technology was both exciting and somewhat clunky, while its bold presence and clear legibility make it suitable for contemporary design projects that seek to stand out.",
