    "detailed_description": "Astro (PX) is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp angles and precise lines, creating a bold and assertive presence. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on horizontals and verticals, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The font's distinctive features include its angular terminals, which add a sense of dynamism and energy, and its consistent stroke weight, which contributes to its clean and modern feel. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves are introduced in certain characters, such as the 'S' and 'C', adding a touch of humanity and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements creates a unique character that is both futuristic and approachable. Astro (PX) is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact and clear legibility are desired. Its bold and confident personality makes it ideal for projects that require a sense of innovation and technological advancement. The font's cultural associations evoke a sense of science fiction and cyberpunk, referencing a future where technology and design are intertwined. Its sharp angles and bold forms suggest a world of advanced technology and futuristic urban landscapes.",
