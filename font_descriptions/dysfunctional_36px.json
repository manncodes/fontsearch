    "detailed_description": "This font is a striking example of geometric construction, built entirely from squares and rectangles. The letterforms are stark and angular, with no curves or serifs, creating a bold and assertive presence. The consistent width of the strokes and the uniform spacing between them contribute to a sense of order and precision. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's starkness and geometric nature evoke a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of early computer interfaces or cyberpunk aesthetics. It's a font that demands attention, suggesting power, efficiency, and a sense of control. Its bold and unyielding character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its lack of warmth or personality might limit its use in more nuanced or emotional contexts.",
