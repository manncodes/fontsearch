    "detailed_description": "Brunst Caps is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that exudes a distinct retro-futuristic vibe. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, creating a dense and impactful visual presence. The font's distinctive feature is its use of exaggerated, almost jagged, terminals, which add a sense of dynamism and energy to the overall design. This combination of geometric precision and playful distortion gives Brunst Caps a unique character, balancing a sense of order with a touch of rebelliousness. While its bold weight and angularity make it suitable for headlines and display applications, its clear legibility and strong presence also make it effective for smaller sizes, particularly in digital contexts. The font's cultural associations lean towards the 1980s and early 1990s, evoking a sense of cyberpunk aesthetics and the rise of digital technology. Its bold, almost aggressive character resonates with contemporary trends in graphic design, particularly in the realm of gaming, streetwear, and futuristic branding.",
