    "detailed_description": "Corpulent Caps is a display typeface that embodies a playful, retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is its exaggerated, three-dimensional form, achieved through a bold outline and a subtle shadow effect. This construction creates a sense of depth and volume, making the letters appear almost tangible. The rounded corners and smooth curves contribute to a friendly, approachable feel, while the consistent stroke weight and geometric proportions maintain a sense of order and clarity. The font's bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other attention-grabbing applications, particularly in digital contexts where its playful nature can be amplified. Its retro-inspired design evokes a sense of nostalgia for the vibrant, optimistic era of 1980s video games and pop culture, while its clean lines and modern execution ensure its relevance in contemporary design.",
