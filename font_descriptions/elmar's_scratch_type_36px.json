    "detailed_description": "Elmar's Scratch Type is a display font that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, jagged strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity, reminiscent of a message hastily scribbled on a wall or a rough sketch in a notebook. The font's construction is based on a combination of geometric and organic forms, with sharp angles and rounded terminals coexisting in a dynamic interplay. This blend of structure and spontaneity gives the font a unique character, making it both visually striking and surprisingly legible. The font's bold, assertive nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its rough, unfinished aesthetic evokes a sense of rebellion and unconventionality, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to break free from traditional design norms. However, its highly stylized nature limits its use in extended text, as its uneven letterforms can make it difficult to read in large blocks of copy.",
