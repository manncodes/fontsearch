    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement, built on a geometric foundation with a distinct, almost mechanical feel. The letters are constructed from a series of parallel lines, creating a strong, almost architectural presence. The consistent width of the strokes and the sharp, angular terminals contribute to this sense of rigidity. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of power and authority, with a hint of retrofuturism. The font's design evokes a sense of industrial strength and precision, reminiscent of machinery or construction. It's a font that commands attention, suggesting a sense of order and control. While its bold nature makes it suitable for headlines and branding, its strong legibility also makes it viable for body text, particularly in digital applications where its geometric structure translates well to screen displays.",
