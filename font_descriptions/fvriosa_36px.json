    "detailed_description": "Fvriosa is a display typeface that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering, with a distinct personality that leans towards the playful and energetic. Its construction is based on a combination of organic and geometric forms, resulting in a unique visual language. The letters are characterized by bold strokes, sharp angles, and a dynamic sense of movement, creating a sense of immediacy and spontaneity. The overall effect is one of youthful exuberance, with a touch of rebelliousness. The font's bold strokes and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its playful nature might not be appropriate for all contexts, particularly those requiring a more formal or traditional aesthetic. Fvriosa's bold and energetic character evokes a sense of youthful energy and creativity, reminiscent of street art and graffiti culture. It suggests a sense of freedom and expression, making it a suitable choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of individuality and nonconformity.",
