    "detailed_description": "GrafiKa Type.1 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by their high x-height, open counters, and sharp terminals, which contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall design is balanced and harmonious, with a slight humanist touch evident in the subtle curves of the terminals and the gentle slopes of the lowercase letters. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives GrafiKa Type.1 a unique personality, making it both authoritative and approachable. Its bold weight and clear forms make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, where it can convey a sense of strength, clarity, and modernity. The typeface's geometric foundation and bold presence evoke a sense of order and structure, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces, where it can communicate a sense of confidence and professionalism without feeling overly formal.",
