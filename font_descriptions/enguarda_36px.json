    "detailed_description": "Enguarda is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost architectural character. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The terminals are often cut at a 45-degree angle, adding to the font's sense of precision and rigidity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'o' introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric structure and subtle organic elements gives Enguarda a unique personality, making it both modern and timeless. Its bold weight and distinct character make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's sharp angles and geometric construction evoke a sense of power and authority, while its subtle curves suggest a touch of approachability. This duality makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from edgy streetwear designs to corporate branding that seeks to convey a sense of confidence and innovation.",
