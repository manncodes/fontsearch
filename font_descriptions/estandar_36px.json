    "detailed_description": "Estandar is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in letters like 'a' and 'g' soften the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Estandar a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. The font's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and modernity, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and user-friendliness. Estandar's versatility makes it a strong choice for branding, editorial design, and user interfaces, where it can convey both clarity and a touch of personality.",
