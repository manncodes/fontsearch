    "detailed_description": "Crae is a playful script font that captures the essence of casual handwritten text. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying widths of strokes and the subtle variations in letterforms, adding a touch of personality to each character. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, Crae maintains a level of legibility thanks to its clear ascenders and descenders. The font's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from handwritten notes and personal branding to social media graphics and informal website designs. Its casual charm and approachable aesthetic make it ideal for projects that require a touch of warmth and personality.",
