    "detailed_description": "Capacitor is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, futuristic aesthetic. Its construction relies on precise angles and clean lines, creating a sense of order and efficiency. The letterforms are primarily composed of horizontal and vertical strokes, with minimal curves or embellishments. This strict geometric approach results in a highly legible typeface, particularly at smaller sizes. The font's sharp terminals and open counters contribute to its clarity and readability, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The overall character of Capacitor is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of modernity and technological advancement. Its sharp angles and minimalist design evoke a sense of precision and control, suggesting a connection to the world of technology and innovation. While its geometric nature might be perceived as cold or impersonal by some, Capacitor's clean lines and strong legibility make it a powerful choice for branding, headlines, and interface design, particularly in contexts where a sense of authority and technological sophistication is desired.",
