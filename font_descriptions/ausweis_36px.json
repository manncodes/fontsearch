    "detailed_description": "Techno Square is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct 3D extrusion effect. Its construction is based on simple, square shapes with sharp corners and minimal curves. The extrusion adds a sense of depth and dimensionality, creating a playful and almost playful feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The consistent weight and bold strokes give it a confident and assertive presence, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of 80s and 90s video game culture, with its pixelated and blocky forms reminiscent of early computer graphics. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to capture a nostalgic or playful tone, while also maintaining a modern and edgy feel.",
