    "detailed_description": "Base 45 136phi is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the stark, angular aesthetics of early video games and 1980s cyberpunk. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in characters with sharp corners, consistent stroke widths, and a distinct lack of curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters and generous spacing between letters ensure clarity even at smaller sizes. The font's bold weight and assertive forms create a sense of power and authority, while the geometric construction lends a sense of order and precision. This combination makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for a time when technology was both exciting and mysterious, making it a compelling choice for projects that seek to capture that spirit. However, its bold weight and angular forms may not be suitable for extended reading, and its lack of stylistic variations could limit its versatility in some applications.",
