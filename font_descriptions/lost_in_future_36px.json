    "detailed_description": "Lost in Future is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a futuristic aesthetic with a strong emphasis on structure and clarity. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in characters composed of sharp, angular lines and precise intersections. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The bold weight and consistent stroke width create a sense of solidity and confidence, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Lost in Future suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to user interfaces and digital displays. Its futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of technological advancement and innovation, making it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of modernity and progress. The font's strong visual presence and clear readability make it particularly effective for conveying information in a concise and impactful manner.",
