    "detailed_description": "Estirada is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle curves gives Estirada a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of modernity and sophistication, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. Estirada's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
