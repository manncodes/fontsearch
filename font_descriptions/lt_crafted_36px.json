    "detailed_description": "LT Crafted is a bold sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to its high legibility, even at smaller sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes LT Crafted suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence evokes a sense of confidence and modernity, while its subtle curves suggest a touch of playfulness and approachability. The font's versatility and strong visual impact make it a compelling choice for projects that require a contemporary and engaging aesthetic.",
