    "detailed_description": "Floane is a contemporary serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a modern sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif design principles, with a clear distinction between thick and thin strokes, but it incorporates subtle, contemporary details that give it a unique character. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, while the slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between classic structure and modern refinement makes Floane versatile for a range of applications, from editorial design and branding to digital interfaces and web typography. Its elegant yet approachable personality makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of sophistication without feeling overly formal. The font's subtle curves and gentle transitions evoke a sense of fluidity and movement, suggesting a contemporary spirit that is both timeless and relevant.",
