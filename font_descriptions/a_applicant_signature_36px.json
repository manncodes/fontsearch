    "detailed_description": "Applicant Signature is a flowing script typeface that captures the immediacy and personality of handwritten text. Its organic forms, characterized by fluid strokes and expressive letterforms, evoke a sense of authenticity and warmth. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The subtle variations in stroke weight and the natural, slightly irregular baseline add to its handcrafted charm. While the overall impression is one of casual elegance, the font's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of projects, from personal branding and social media graphics to invitations and packaging. Its inherent warmth and approachability make it particularly well-suited for projects that seek to convey a sense of connection and personality.",
