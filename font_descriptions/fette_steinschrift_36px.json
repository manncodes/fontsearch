    "detailed_description": "Fette Steinschrift is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on simple, clean lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of solidity and power. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, further emphasizing the font's bold presence. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility even at smaller sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded corners of the 'a' and 'o', prevent the font from feeling overly cold or mechanical. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Fette Steinschrift a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for headlines, branding, and even body text, particularly in contexts where a strong, confident voice is desired. The font's bold presence and geometric construction evoke a sense of authority and modernity, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact. Its cultural associations range from industrial design and architecture to contemporary street art and graphic design, reflecting its versatility and adaptability to different contexts.",
