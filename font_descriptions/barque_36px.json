    "detailed_description": "Barque 36px is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its bold and assertive presence. The open counters and consistent stroke weights ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of Barque 36px is bold and confident, with a touch of retro charm. It evokes a sense of digital nostalgia, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and pixelated graphics. This retro feel is further enhanced by the slightly rounded terminals, which add a touch of playfulness to the otherwise rigid structure. The font's bold and confident nature makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro aesthetic also lends itself well to projects that require a playful and nostalgic feel. However, its geometric construction and sharp corners might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
