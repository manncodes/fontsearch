Its upright posture and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while subtle variations in letterforms add visual interest. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, balancing the formality of the overall design. This combination of traditional structure and modern sensibility makes Flerija suitable for a wide range of applications, from editorial layouts and branding to digital interfaces and signage. Its versatility allows it to convey both professionalism and approachability, making it a strong choice for projects that require a timeless yet contemporary aesthetic.",
