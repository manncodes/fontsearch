    "detailed_description": "Harlequin is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a strong, legible structure. Its defining feature is the distinctive dotted outline that surrounds each letterform, adding a whimsical touch while maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. The rounded terminals and generous curves contribute to a friendly, approachable feel, while the bold strokes and consistent weight create a sense of confidence and impact. This combination of playful details and robust construction makes Harlequin suitable for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful branding and quirky illustrations. Its bold presence and whimsical charm evoke a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of vintage carnival signage or classic comic book lettering, while its clear legibility ensures it remains effective even at smaller sizes.",
