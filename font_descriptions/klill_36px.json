    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic sans-serif designs. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural, proportions of the letterforms. The terminals are sharp and well-defined, contributing to a sense of precision and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, enhancing legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall weight is light, lending a sense of airiness and sophistication. While the font's geometric foundation suggests a sense of order and rationality, the subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanism makes the font feel both modern and timeless. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's overall character evokes a sense of professionalism and confidence, while its subtle warmth suggests a friendly and approachable demeanor. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of personality.",
