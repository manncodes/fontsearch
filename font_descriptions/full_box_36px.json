    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, outlined forms, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric construction, evident in the sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slight rounding of the terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', adds a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanization makes it versatile for both digital and print applications, lending itself to bold headlines, playful branding, and even retro-inspired interfaces. The font's overall character evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of the bold graphic design of the 1960s and 1970s, while its clean lines and modern construction feel distinctly contemporary.",
