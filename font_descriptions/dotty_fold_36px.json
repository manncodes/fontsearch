    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, blocky forms and distinct pixelated edges, embodies a retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric construction is evident in the sharp angles and consistent proportions, creating a sense of order and precision. The pixelated effect, reminiscent of early video game graphics, adds a playful and nostalgic touch. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces and display applications. The font's bold character and playful edge make it ideal for projects that require a sense of energy and retro charm, evoking a sense of the 80s and 90s while remaining relevant in contemporary digital culture.",
