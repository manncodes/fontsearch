    "detailed_description": "Beckman is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric sans-serifs. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and precise angles of the letterforms. The terminals are sharp and well-defined, contributing to a sense of clarity and efficiency. The x-height is relatively high, enhancing legibility, especially in smaller sizes. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Beckman versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for both large-scale displays and small-scale text, while its contemporary feel aligns with modern design trends. The font evokes a sense of professionalism and confidence, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable.",
