    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, irregular strokes and a distinct lack of uniformity, embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. The letterforms are crafted with a freehand, almost gestural approach, resulting in a highly expressive and dynamic typeface. Each character exhibits unique variations in stroke thickness and angle, creating a sense of spontaneity and individuality. The overall effect is one of immediacy and authenticity, as if the letters were drawn directly onto the page with a marker or brush. This raw, unpolished quality makes it ideal for projects that demand a sense of energy, authenticity, and a touch of rebellion. The font's inherent imperfections add a layer of human touch, making it feel less sterile and more relatable.",
