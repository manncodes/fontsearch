    "detailed_description": "Railway Script is a bold and playful display typeface that draws inspiration from vintage signage and hand-painted lettering. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and pronounced curves, creates a strong visual impact, while the exaggerated x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at large sizes. The font's distinctive features include the rounded terminals, which add a touch of approachability to its otherwise assertive character, and the unique lowercase 'a' and 'g' forms, which contribute to its playful personality. Railway Script is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a bold and eye-catching aesthetic is desired. Its vintage-inspired design evokes a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, while its contemporary execution makes it feel fresh and relevant. The font's bold and playful nature suggests a sense of energy and excitement, making it ideal for projects that aim to capture attention and convey a sense of fun.",
