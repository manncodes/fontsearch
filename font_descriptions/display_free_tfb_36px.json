    "detailed_description": "This font is a digital interpretation of classic geometric sans-serif designs, with a strong emphasis on clarity and legibility. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in characters with consistent proportions and sharp, well-defined angles. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring readability even at small sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall character of the font is clean, modern, and functional, with a hint of retro charm. It evokes the aesthetic of early digital displays and computer interfaces, reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s. This nostalgic quality adds a touch of playfulness to its otherwise serious demeanor. The font's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from website design and mobile apps to branding and editorial layouts. Its clean lines and bold presence make it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility ensures readability in body text. However, its geometric nature might limit its use in more traditional or formal contexts.",
