    "detailed_description": "Bimasakti is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, angular shapes with a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of solidity and power. The letters are tightly spaced, adding to the compact and assertive character. The font's most striking feature is the double outline, which adds a sense of depth and dimension, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or sci-fi movie titles. This bold outline also contributes to the font's strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is one of futuristic energy, the rounded terminals and slightly softened corners prevent it from feeling overly harsh or cold. This balance makes Bimasakti suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and even retro-inspired designs. Its strong personality and nostalgic appeal evoke a sense of optimism and technological advancement, making it a compelling choice for projects seeking a confident and energetic visual identity.",
