    "detailed_description": "This sans-serif typeface exhibits a distinct geometric construction, with letterforms built from straight lines and sharp angles. The overall aesthetic is clean and modern, reminiscent of early digital typography. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The bold strokes and consistent weight create a sense of confidence and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. The font's bold presence and clean lines evoke a sense of efficiency and modernity, suggesting a connection to technology and innovation. It carries a subtle retro-futuristic vibe, hinting at a time when technology was seen as a force for progress and optimism.",
