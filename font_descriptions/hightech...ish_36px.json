    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and sharp, unornamented forms, embodies a stark, functional aesthetic. The consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs create a sense of clarity and precision, reminiscent of digital interfaces and technical drawings. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. While the overall impression is one of coldness and objectivity, the subtle rounding of the terminals and the slight variation in letterforms, particularly in the lowercase, inject a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between technical precision and subtle warmth makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to user interfaces, where a clean, modern aesthetic is desired.",
