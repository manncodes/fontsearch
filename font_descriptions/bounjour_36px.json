    "detailed_description": "Font' Bonjour is a playful script typeface that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character is friendly and approachable, with a touch of whimsy. The font's design is reminiscent of casual handwritten notes, evoking a sense of personal connection and authenticity. It's well-suited for branding projects that require a touch of personality, such as social media graphics, invitations, and packaging. However, its informal nature might not be appropriate for formal documents or corporate communications. The font's cultural associations lean towards contemporary trends in design, suggesting a youthful and energetic vibe.",
