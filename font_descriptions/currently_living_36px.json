    "detailed_description": "This font, with its name \"Currently Living (360TX)\", embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic reminiscent of urban graffiti. The letterforms are constructed with a distinct hand-drawn quality, featuring exaggerated angles, sharp terminals, and a dynamic, almost chaotic, flow. The irregular stroke weights and inconsistent letter spacing contribute to the font's raw, unpolished character, suggesting a sense of spontaneity and immediacy. While the overall impression is bold and assertive, the font retains a playful energy, evident in the playful curves of the lowercase 'a' and 'g' and the slightly tilted angles of the numerals. This font is ideal for projects that demand a bold, street-inspired aesthetic, such as streetwear branding, music posters, or edgy digital graphics. Its raw energy and unrefined character evoke a sense of rebellion and individuality, aligning with contemporary subcultures that embrace authenticity and self-expression.",
