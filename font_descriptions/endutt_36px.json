    "detailed_description": "Endutt is a playful display typeface that embraces a bold, rounded aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by generous curves and exaggerated proportions, creating a sense of friendly informality. The letterforms are built with a focus on visual impact, featuring large, open counters and a high x-height that ensures legibility even at smaller sizes. The rounded terminals and smooth transitions between strokes contribute to its approachable and inviting character. Endutt's design evokes a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering or cartoon typography. Its bold presence and playful nature make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and playful digital interfaces. While its rounded forms might limit its use in extended text blocks, Endutt excels in capturing attention and conveying a sense of fun and energy.",
