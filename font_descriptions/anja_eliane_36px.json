    "detailed_description": "Anja Eliane is a bold, playful sans-serif font with a distinct rounded aesthetic. Its generous curves and open counters create a friendly and approachable feel, while the consistent stroke weight and geometric construction lend a sense of stability and clarity. The font's high x-height and generous ascenders and descenders ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of playful curves and structural solidity makes Anja Eliane suitable for a wide range of applications, from children's books and branding to website headers and playful signage. The font's overall character evokes a sense of fun and optimism, reminiscent of vintage cartoon graphics and playful 1950s design. Its bold presence and friendly demeanor make it a great choice for projects that require a touch of whimsy and approachability.",
