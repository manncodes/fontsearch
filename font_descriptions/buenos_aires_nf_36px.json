    "detailed_description": "Buenos Aires NF is a striking display typeface that embodies a retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a geometric grid, with each letterform composed of parallel lines that create a sense of depth and dimensionality. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes. The sharp terminals and consistent stroke weights contribute to a clean and modern feel, while the subtle variations in letterform proportions add a touch of personality. Buenos Aires NF evokes a sense of playful energy and retro charm, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video game graphics. Its bold and distinctive style makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements that demand attention. However, its limited character set and lack of italics may limit its versatility for extended text.",
