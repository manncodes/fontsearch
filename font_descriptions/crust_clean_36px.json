    "detailed_description": "Crust Clean is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with a distinct grunge aesthetic. Its letterforms are based on simple, clean shapes, but they are overlaid with a textured, distressed effect that gives the font a raw, edgy feel. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven, slightly jagged edges add a sense of grit and authenticity. This combination of clean geometry and rough texture creates a unique personality that is both modern and nostalgic, evoking a sense of urban grit and DIY culture. Crust Clean is well-suited for headlines, branding, and display applications where a bold, attention-grabbing aesthetic is desired. Its versatility allows it to be used in both digital and print media, adding a touch of rebellious energy to any project.",
