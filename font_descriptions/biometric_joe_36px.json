    "detailed_description": "Biometric Joe is a display typeface that embraces a bold, distorted aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by exaggerated, almost grotesque letterforms with sharp angles and jagged edges. The font's design is heavily influenced by the aesthetics of horror and sci-fi, evoking a sense of unease and tension. The exaggerated proportions and uneven spacing contribute to its dramatic and unsettling character. While its legibility is compromised at smaller sizes, Biometric Joe excels in large displays, where its bold presence and dramatic impact can be fully appreciated. It's a font that demands attention, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual statement, such as horror movie posters, cyberpunk-themed designs, or edgy branding.",
