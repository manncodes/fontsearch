    "detailed_description": "Libby is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Libby versatile, suitable for both digital interfaces and print applications. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for body text and editorial design. Libby's overall character evokes a sense of professionalism and approachability, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to personal websites. Its clean lines and modern feel suggest a forward-thinking approach, while the subtle warmth hints at a human touch, creating a sense of trust and connection.",
