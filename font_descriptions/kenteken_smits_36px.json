    "detailed_description": "Kenteken Smits is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through the introduction of subtle curves in the terminals, particularly noticeable in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g'. This slight humanist touch adds a touch of approachability and softens the overall impression. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. Its versatility extends to a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. The overall character of Kenteken Smits evokes a sense of professionalism and modernity, suggesting a brand that is both reliable and forward-thinking. Its clean lines and balanced proportions resonate with contemporary design sensibilities, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of warmth and approachability.",
