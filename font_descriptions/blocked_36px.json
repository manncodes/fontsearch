    "detailed_description": "Blocked is a geometric sans-serif typeface built on a grid system, with each character constructed from a series of squares. This strict construction creates a bold, confident presence, reminiscent of early digital typography and pixel art. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to its clean, modern aesthetic, while the slight rounding of the corners adds a touch of approachability, preventing it from feeling overly rigid. Blocked's bold, graphic nature evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 8-bit video games and early computer interfaces. This nostalgic quality, combined with its contemporary legibility, makes it ideal for projects that require a playful yet professional feel, such as branding for tech companies, gaming platforms, or creative agencies.",
