    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric design, built on a grid with sharp angles and strong, contrasting shapes. The uppercase letters are particularly striking, with each form reduced to its most essential elements. The lowercase letters, while maintaining the geometric foundation, exhibit a slightly more playful character, with rounded terminals and subtle curves adding a touch of approachability. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, with a strong visual impact that feels both assertive and approachable. The font's bold weight and high x-height ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces. Its geometric construction and sharp angles lend a sense of precision and authority, while the subtle curves and rounded terminals add a touch of warmth and personality. This balance makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence without feeling overly aggressive or cold.",
