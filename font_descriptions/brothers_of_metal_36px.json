    "detailed_description": "Default Terror Gothic Modern is a bold and angular typeface that draws inspiration from the iconic imagery of heavy metal music. Its geometric construction, characterized by sharp angles and pronounced serifs, creates a sense of power and aggression. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The distinctive letterforms, particularly the stylized 'A' and 'S', evoke a sense of rebellion and defiance, aligning with the rebellious spirit of heavy metal culture. The font's bold and assertive character makes it ideal for conveying a sense of energy, intensity, and raw power, making it a perfect choice for branding, posters, album covers, and other projects that require a strong visual impact. While its angularity might seem intimidating at first glance, the font's overall structure is balanced and legible, making it a versatile tool for designers seeking to inject a dose of heavy metal attitude into their work.",
