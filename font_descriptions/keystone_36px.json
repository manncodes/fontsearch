    "detailed_description": "Keystone is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost architectural presence. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by sharp corners, straight lines, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance readability. While the overall impression is one of starkness and simplicity, Keystone's slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions inject a touch of humanity, preventing it from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Keystone suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital displays. Its clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of modernity and technological advancement, making it a fitting choice for projects that require a contemporary and confident aesthetic. Keystone's bold, assertive character also suggests a sense of authority and reliability, making it suitable for applications where these qualities are desired.",
