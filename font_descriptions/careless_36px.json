    "detailed_description": "Careless (36px) is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost chaotic energy. Its construction relies heavily on geometric shapes, with each letterform built from a series of sharp angles and jagged edges. This results in a highly distinctive and visually striking aesthetic, reminiscent of early digital art or pixelated graphics. The font's irregular proportions and inconsistent letter spacing contribute to its sense of spontaneity and unpredictability. While the overall design is bold and attention-grabbing, the font's legibility remains surprisingly strong, thanks to its generous x-height and open counters. This makes it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its unconventional nature might limit its use in extended body text or situations requiring a more formal tone. Careless (36px) evokes a sense of youthful rebellion and creative freedom, suggesting a playful and irreverent spirit. It's a font that embraces imperfection and celebrates the unexpected, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to stand out from the crowd.",
