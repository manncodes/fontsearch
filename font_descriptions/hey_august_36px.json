    "detailed_description": "Hey August is a display typeface that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering with a touch of digital polish. Its construction is based on a fluid, calligraphic stroke, but with carefully controlled variations in weight and angle to ensure legibility. The ascenders and descenders are extended, creating a dynamic rhythm, while the rounded terminals and open counters contribute to a friendly, approachable feel. The font's personality is both playful and confident, suggesting a sense of youthful energy and creativity. It draws inspiration from vintage signage and hand-painted lettering, but with a contemporary edge that makes it suitable for a wide range of digital applications. Hey August is particularly effective for headlines, logos, and branding elements where its bold character and expressive nature can shine. Its versatility allows it to be used in both large and small sizes, though its calligraphic nature may require careful spacing and kerning for optimal readability in smaller point sizes.",
