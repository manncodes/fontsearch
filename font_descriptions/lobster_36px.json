    "detailed_description": "Lobster is a playful script font that blends vintage charm with contemporary appeal. Its flowing, calligraphic strokes are reminiscent of hand-lettering, but its bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive features include its exaggerated swashes, rounded terminals, and playful ligatures, which add a touch of whimsy and personality to any design. While its overall character is lighthearted and approachable, Lobster also possesses a certain sophistication due to its carefully balanced proportions and consistent stroke weights. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to website headers and social media graphics. Lobster's cultural resonance lies in its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia and fun, reminiscent of classic carnival signage and vintage movie posters. Its contemporary relevance is evident in its widespread use in digital design, where it adds a touch of personality and warmth to otherwise sterile interfaces.",
