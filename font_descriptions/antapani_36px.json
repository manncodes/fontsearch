    "detailed_description": "Antapani is a sans-serif typeface that balances a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are generally square and compact, with a high x-height that contributes to its strong legibility. However, the terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability that softens the geometric rigidity. This combination creates a font that feels both modern and approachable, suitable for a wide range of applications. The overall character is confident and professional, yet not overly formal. It evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, making it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of ligatures and alternate glyphs, allowing for creative typographic solutions.",
