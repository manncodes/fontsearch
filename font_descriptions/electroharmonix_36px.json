    "detailed_description": "ElectroHarmonix (36px) is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on clean, angular lines and sharp corners, creating a strong, confident presence. The letterforms are tightly spaced, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of futuristic energy and technological precision, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and science fiction imagery. The font's bold weight and sharp angles lend it a sense of authority and power, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its retro-futuristic aesthetic also adds a touch of playfulness and whimsy, making it suitable for projects that require a balance of seriousness and fun.",
