    "detailed_description": "DustHome is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the edges, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The overall character of DustHome is confident and approachable, suggesting a balance between professionalism and approachability. It draws inspiration from the clean lines and functional design of mid-century modernism, but with a contemporary twist that feels fresh and relevant. This makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial and interface design. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for more human-centric applications.",
