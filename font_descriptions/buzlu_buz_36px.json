    "detailed_description": "Buzzlu Buzz is a display typeface characterized by its bold, three-dimensional construction. Each letterform is rendered with a distinct extruded effect, creating a sense of depth and volume. The rounded corners and generous curves contribute to a friendly and approachable aesthetic, while the consistent stroke weight and clean lines maintain a sense of professionalism. This combination of playful dimensionality and refined execution makes Buzzlu Buzz suitable for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful branding and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and playful nature evoke a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics and futuristic sci-fi designs. The font's playful yet professional character makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy without sacrificing readability.",
