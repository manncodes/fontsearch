    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, outlined forms, evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. The geometric construction of the letters, with sharp angles and pronounced curves, creates a sense of dynamism and energy. The thick outlines, reminiscent of neon signs or early computer graphics, add a playful and almost cartoonish quality. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and digital interfaces. The overall effect is one of bold confidence and playful energy, suggesting a brand that is both futuristic and approachable.",
