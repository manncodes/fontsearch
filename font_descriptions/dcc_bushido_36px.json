    "detailed_description": "DCC Bushido is a bold, sans-serif typeface that combines a geometric construction with a distinct grunge aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by their strong, angular shapes and heavy weights, creating a sense of power and authority. The addition of subtle texture and distressed edges, however, softens the overall impression, adding a touch of grit and authenticity. This combination of geometric precision and organic imperfection gives the font a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to edgy streetwear designs and digital interfaces. The font's bold presence and gritty texture evoke a sense of urban grit and rebellious spirit, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of rebellious attitude.",
