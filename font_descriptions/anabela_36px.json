    "detailed_description": "Anabela is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet confident retro aesthetic. Its geometric construction, with rounded corners and a distinct 3D extrusion, evokes a sense of playful energy reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or futuristic sci-fi designs. The font's bold, chunky forms and generous letter spacing create a strong visual presence, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and eye-catching titles. While the overall design is geometric, subtle variations in letterforms, such as the rounded terminals and slightly angled strokes, add a touch of humanism, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. The 3D effect, achieved through a subtle gradient and shadow, adds depth and dimension, further enhancing its playful and futuristic character. Anabela's bold personality and retro charm make it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of nostalgia, a sense of fun, or a futuristic edge.",
