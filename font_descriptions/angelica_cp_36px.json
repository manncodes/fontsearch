    "detailed_description": "Angelica is a display typeface that embodies a playful retro aesthetic. Its construction is based on a combination of geometric shapes and organic curves, resulting in a unique and eye-catching visual style. The letters are bold and chunky, with a strong emphasis on circular forms, particularly in the lowercase letters. The overall effect is one of playful energy and a sense of nostalgia for the mid-century design era. The font's distinctive features include its use of negative space within the letterforms, creating a sense of depth and dimension. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its friendly and approachable character. Angelica is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold and playful visual statement is desired. Its retro charm and strong visual presence make it a perfect choice for projects that aim to evoke a sense of fun and nostalgia.",
