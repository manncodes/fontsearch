    "detailed_description": "Cotono is a geometric sans-serif font built on a grid-based structure, with each letterform composed of straight lines and sharp corners. This strict construction creates a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early digital typography and the minimalist aesthetic of the 1960s. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The consistent stroke weight and lack of embellishments contribute to its clean and modern feel, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Cotono's bold and confident character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and interface design, particularly in contexts where a strong visual presence and a sense of technological sophistication are desired. Its minimalist aesthetic and geometric construction evoke a sense of efficiency and clarity, aligning with contemporary trends in design and technology.",
