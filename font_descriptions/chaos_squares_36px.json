    "detailed_description": "Chaos Square is a display typeface that embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by a combination of geometric shapes and organic, hand-drawn elements, resulting in a unique and unpredictable visual language. The letters are often asymmetrical, with uneven strokes and jagged edges, creating a sense of energy and movement. This deliberate imperfection adds a layer of grit and authenticity to the font, making it feel both modern and nostalgic. The font's bold, chunky forms and generous x-height ensure strong legibility even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding elements that demand attention. Its raw, unpolished character evokes a sense of rebellion and individuality, aligning with contemporary trends in graphic design that embrace imperfection and authenticity. Chaos Square's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of contexts, from edgy streetwear designs to bold editorial layouts, adding a touch of rebellious spirit to any project.",
