    "detailed_description": "Lesteratic CSS is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a strong sense of legibility. Its construction is based on a combination of geometric and humanist principles, resulting in a unique visual language. The letters are characterized by their bold strokes, open counters, and distinctive terminals, often featuring sharp angles and playful flourishes. This combination creates a font that is both eye-catching and easy to read, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from headlines and logos to posters and digital interfaces. The font's playful nature evokes a sense of fun and energy, while its strong legibility ensures that it remains clear and impactful even at smaller sizes. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to capture the attention of a digital audience, while its historical influences can be seen in its playful use of decorative elements and its overall sense of whimsy.",
