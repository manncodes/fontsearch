    "detailed_description": "Foglihten No 04 is a serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a touch of playful whimsy. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif design principles, with a clear distinction between thick and thin strokes, carefully balanced proportions, and a consistent baseline. However, the font's personality is infused with a subtle sense of playfulness through the inclusion of delicate flourishes and swashes, particularly noticeable in the lowercase letters and some uppercase characters like 'Q' and 'S'. These flourishes, while adding a touch of ornamentation, are kept restrained, ensuring the font remains legible and versatile. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both refined and approachable, suitable for a range of applications from formal invitations to modern branding projects. Its historical roots are evident in the classic serif structure, evoking a sense of tradition and timelessness, while the playful flourishes add a contemporary twist, suggesting a touch of personality and charm. This balance makes Foglihten No 04 a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of elegance without sacrificing readability or a sense of modern appeal.",
