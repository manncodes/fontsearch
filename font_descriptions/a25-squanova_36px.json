    "detailed_description": "A25-Squamova is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a bold, confident presence. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, proportions, with each letterform built from a series of clean, sharp angles. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, contributing to excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the font's assertive character. The overall effect is one of strength and clarity, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. This font is well-suited for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of authority and modernity, making it ideal for projects that require a confident and assertive tone. The font's cultural associations range from the early days of personal computing to the resurgence of retro-futuristic aesthetics in contemporary design.",
