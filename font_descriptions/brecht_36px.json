    "detailed_description": "Brecht is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are characterized by their rectangular shapes, with rounded corners that soften the overall impression. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, titles, and branding elements. Its playful nature, however, also lends itself to more informal applications, such as children's books, game design, and digital interfaces. The overall effect is a font that is both modern and approachable, evoking a sense of playful confidence and a touch of retro charm.",
