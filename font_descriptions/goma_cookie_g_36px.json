    "detailed_description": "Goma Cookie G is a playful and approachable display font that combines rounded, geometric forms with a touch of hand-drawn charm. Its bold, chunky letterforms are built on a circular base, with each character featuring smooth, continuous curves and rounded terminals. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at large sizes. The font's overall character is friendly and inviting, with a slight retro feel reminiscent of 1970s cartoon graphics. This makes it ideal for projects that require a sense of fun and whimsy, such as children's books, branding for playful products, or eye-catching headlines. While its bold weight and rounded forms make it suitable for large-scale applications, its playful nature might not be appropriate for formal or corporate settings. The font's cultural resonance lies in its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia and lightheartedness, tapping into a shared memory of playful design from a bygone era.",
