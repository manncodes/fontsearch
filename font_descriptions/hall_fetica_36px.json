    "detailed_description": "Hall Fetica is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The letters are characterized by sharp corners, open counters, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of clarity and order. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its readability, especially in smaller sizes. The overall design is minimalist, with a focus on functionality and efficiency. While the geometric construction lends a sense of formality and professionalism, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterforms add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance makes Hall Fetica suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of innovation and technological advancement, making it a fitting choice for projects that require a contemporary and sophisticated aesthetic.",
