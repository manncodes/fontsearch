    "detailed_description": "This font, reminiscent of ancient runes, is characterized by its bold, angular strokes and a distinct lack of serifs. The glyphs are constructed with a strong emphasis on verticality, creating a sense of power and stability. The sharp, pointed terminals add to the aggressive feel, while the overall structure is geometric, lending a sense of order and precision. The font's bold weight and dramatic forms make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its historical associations with ancient cultures and its contemporary relevance to fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics make it a compelling choice for projects seeking to evoke a sense of mystery, power, or otherworldly intrigue.",
