    "detailed_description": "Good Dog is a playful and expressive script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its irregular, bouncy strokes and exaggerated letterforms create a sense of whimsy and informality. The font's construction is based on a loose, organic structure, with varying stroke weights and angles that add to its hand-drawn aesthetic. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the font's overall character is lighthearted and friendly, it also possesses a certain robustness due to the bold strokes and confident letterforms. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from playful branding and social media graphics to children's books and informal invitations. The font's cultural associations lean towards contemporary trends in design, evoking a sense of authenticity and personal expression. It's a font that feels both familiar and fresh, reflecting the casual and creative spirit of modern digital culture.",
