    "detailed_description": "Defecto is a bold and dramatic display typeface that draws inspiration from gothic script and blackletter styles. Its sharp, angular strokes and exaggerated flourishes create a sense of intensity and grandeur. The font's construction is based on a combination of geometric and organic elements, resulting in a unique visual language that is both striking and legible. The high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, while the intricate details and flowing curves add a touch of elegance and sophistication. Defecto's bold personality makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its historical roots in gothic script evoke a sense of tradition and authority, while its contemporary design sensibility makes it relevant for modern projects. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of contexts, from traditional branding to edgy digital design.",
