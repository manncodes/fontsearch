    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, three-dimensional construction, exudes a strong, almost industrial presence. The letters are built with a clear geometric foundation, featuring sharp corners and defined edges, creating a sense of solidity and structure. The exaggerated depth of the extrusion adds to this impression, suggesting a physical object rather than a flat graphic. This boldness is further emphasized by the generous x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is one of strength and authority, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in some letterforms, like the 'S' and 'C', inject a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly harsh or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to technical illustrations and even playful digital interfaces. The font's inherent three-dimensionality evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics and early computer graphics, while its clean lines and strong presence also feel distinctly modern, suggesting a confident and forward-looking approach.",
