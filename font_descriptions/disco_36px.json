    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of retro futurism, built on a foundation of geometric shapes and exaggerated proportions. Each letter is constructed from a series of parallel lines, creating a dynamic, almost 3D effect. The lines are slightly offset, adding a subtle sense of movement and depth. The overall impression is one of confident energy, reminiscent of 1970s sci-fi and graphic design. The font's bold, almost cartoonish style makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its intricate construction and large size may limit its use in smaller text sizes or for extended reading. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to a period of technological optimism and artistic experimentation, evoking a sense of playful futurism that remains relevant in contemporary design.",
