    "detailed_description": "Higher Reach is a bold, expressive script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its flowing strokes and dynamic angles create a sense of movement and spontaneity, reminiscent of a quick, confident brushstroke. The font's irregular baseline and varying letter heights add to its natural, hand-drawn aesthetic. While the overall impression is casual and energetic, the font maintains a degree of legibility through its clear, well-defined letterforms. The generous x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's playful personality and contemporary feel make it ideal for branding, packaging, and digital interfaces that seek to convey a sense of authenticity and youthful energy. Its versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from casual social media posts to more formal marketing materials, adding a touch of personality and dynamism to any project.",
