    "detailed_description": "Crumpled (36px) is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost chaotic energy. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated distortion of each letterform, as if they've been crumpled and then flattened out. This effect is achieved through a combination of bold strokes, uneven curves, and exaggerated angles. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at larger sizes, while the irregular shapes create a sense of movement and dynamism. The overall effect is one of fun and informality, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and other eye-catching applications. While its bold, distorted forms might seem unconventional, Crumpled (36px) possesses a certain charm that evokes a sense of playful rebellion. It's a font that doesn't take itself too seriously, and it encourages its users to embrace a similar attitude. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to capture a youthful, energetic, or even slightly subversive spirit.",
