    "detailed_description": "Cablegram is a font that embodies a playful yet sophisticated approach to geometric design. Its construction is based on a series of parallel lines, creating a distinct three-dimensional effect. The letters are built with a consistent stroke width, resulting in a clean and modern aesthetic. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to a sense of approachability, while the overall structure maintains a strong sense of order and precision. This combination of geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes Cablegram versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines to playful branding. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of the early days of digital design. The font's bold presence and clear legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its playful nature allows it to be used effectively in smaller sizes for branding and editorial design.",
