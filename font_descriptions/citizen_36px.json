    "detailed_description": "Citizen PX is a bold, graphic font that uses the American flag as its primary design element. Each letter is constructed from a series of stacked stripes, creating a three-dimensional effect. The font's strong, geometric forms and sharp angles give it a powerful and assertive personality, reminiscent of vintage Americana and patriotic imagery. The use of the flag as a visual motif adds a layer of cultural significance, evoking themes of national pride and unity. While the font's bold design makes it suitable for large-scale displays and headlines, its intricate details and subtle variations in the stripes create a sense of depth and texture that can also be appreciated at smaller sizes. Citizen PX is a versatile font that can be used to create a range of visual effects, from bold and impactful statements to subtle and nuanced designs.",
