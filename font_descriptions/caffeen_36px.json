    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction, evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and 80s sci-fi aesthetics. The characters are built from a series of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a distinct, almost pixelated appearance. The consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to a clean, uncluttered feel, while the subtle double-outline effect adds a touch of depth and dimension. This combination of technical precision and playful retro styling makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, particularly in digital contexts. The font's bold, confident personality lends itself to headlines, logos, and branding elements, while its retro charm can be used to evoke a sense of nostalgia or futuristic optimism.",
