    "detailed_description": "Driveller 36px is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1980s. Its construction is based on a series of overlapping, parallel lines, creating a distinctive three-dimensional effect. This layering adds visual weight and a sense of depth, while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The sharp terminals and consistent stroke widths contribute to its confident and assertive personality. Driveller 36px is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the era of arcade games and synthwave music, while its clean lines and bold presence feel contemporary and impactful. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from retro-inspired branding to modern digital interfaces.",
