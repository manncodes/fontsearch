    "detailed_description": "Font: \"Aneirin\" (36px) by Dieter Steffmann | Gothic | Celtic\n\nAneirin is a bold and decorative display typeface that draws inspiration from traditional Gothic and Celtic lettering styles. Its construction is characterized by sharp angles, pronounced serifs, and intricate flourishes, creating a visually striking and impactful aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the exaggerated ascenders and descenders add to its dramatic presence. The overall character of Aneirin is both elegant and assertive, conveying a sense of history, tradition, and authority. Its intricate details and bold strokes evoke a sense of craftsmanship and artistry, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of sophistication and grandeur. While its traditional roots are evident, Aneirin's contemporary design sensibilities make it adaptable to a range of modern applications, from branding and packaging to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold and decorative nature lends itself well to headlines, titles, and other prominent text elements, adding a touch of visual interest and personality to any design.",
