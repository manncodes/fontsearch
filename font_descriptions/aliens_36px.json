    "detailed_description": "The font is a playful and whimsical display typeface featuring a unique design that resembles a pair of cartoon eyes with arms and legs. Each character is formed by two circles representing the eyes, connected by a curved line that acts as the body. The arms and legs are stylized as simple lines extending from the circles, giving the characters a dynamic and energetic feel. The font is primarily black and white, with a bold and contrasting design that makes it easily legible even at small sizes. The overall aesthetic is lighthearted and fun, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality.",
