    "detailed_description": "Best Marker is a playful script font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, slightly wobbly strokes evoke the immediacy of a marker pen, creating a sense of casual authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the rounded terminals and playful swashes add a touch of whimsy. This combination of legibility and personality makes it ideal for informal branding, social media graphics, and playful headlines. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of warmth and approachability, suggesting a connection to personal expression and creative energy. It's a font that feels both nostalgic and contemporary, referencing the DIY spirit of hand-lettering while embracing the digital world's emphasis on authenticity.",
