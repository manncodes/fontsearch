    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, presents a bold and angular aesthetic. Its sharp corners and straight lines create a sense of rigidity and precision, reminiscent of early digital interfaces. The consistent stroke weight and uniform letterforms contribute to a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly extended terminals add a touch of dynamism. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, suggesting a blend of technical prowess and artistic intention. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. Its bold presence and clear structure make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's geometric nature evokes a sense of futuristic technology, while its sharp edges and bold forms suggest a sense of power and authority.",
