    "detailed_description": "\u201cGang of Three\u201d is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The bold weight and sharp terminals give it a commanding presence, while the slightly rounded corners add a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes it versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines to digital interfaces. The font's strong, confident character evokes a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for projects that require a bold statement. Its contemporary aesthetic and digital-native design make it ideal for branding, web design, and mobile applications. The font's bold, geometric nature also lends itself to use in signage, posters, and other large-scale applications.",
