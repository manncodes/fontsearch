    "detailed_description": "Fretline is a bold, italic typeface that embodies a dynamic energy. Its construction is based on a strong, geometric foundation, with characters built from clean, angular strokes. The italic angle is pronounced, adding a sense of motion and speed. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The bold weight and sharp terminals contribute to a confident and assertive personality, while the italic slant adds a touch of playfulness. Fretline's design evokes a sense of retro-futurism, reminiscent of 1970s sci-fi aesthetics. Its bold, italic style suggests a sense of speed and action, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. The font's versatility extends to digital applications, where its bold weight and clear forms ensure readability on screens. Fretline's bold, italic style and retro-futuristic aesthetic make it a powerful tool for creating eye-catching designs that convey a sense of energy and dynamism.",
