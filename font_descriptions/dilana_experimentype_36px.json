    "detailed_description": "Dilana Experimentype is a display typeface that blends classic calligraphic flourishes with a contemporary, almost whimsical, sensibility. Its construction is based on traditional penmanship, evident in the flowing strokes and elegant swashes. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated curves and intricate details, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. The font's personality is both playful and sophisticated, suggesting a touch of theatricality and a hint of mystery. While its ornate nature makes it ideal for headlines and decorative elements, its legibility is surprisingly strong, particularly in larger sizes. The font's cultural associations range from historical manuscripts and medieval art to modern fantasy literature and graphic design, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of the extraordinary.",
