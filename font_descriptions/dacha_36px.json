    "detailed_description": "Dacha is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights, giving it a sense of order and clarity. However, the rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on lowercase letters introduce a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. Dacha's overall character is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a sense of clarity and efficiency. It evokes a modern aesthetic, reminiscent of mid-century design trends, but with a contemporary edge. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps. Dacha's clean lines and approachable personality make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
