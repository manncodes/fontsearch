    "detailed_description": "Fontopo Neutral exhibits a clean, contemporary aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a high x-height, contributing to its strong legibility. The open counters and well-defined terminals further enhance readability, particularly at smaller sizes. While the overall structure is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance creates a font that feels both modern and inviting. Fontopo Neutral's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces and mobile apps to branding materials and editorial design. Its clean lines and neutral character allow it to seamlessly integrate into various visual contexts, while its strong legibility ensures readability across different screen sizes and media. The font's contemporary feel evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and accessibility, aligning with the values of modern digital culture.",
