    "detailed_description": "Bold Face Lie is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, assertive presence. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, proportions, with a high x-height and a consistent stroke weight throughout. The letterforms are clean and uncluttered, with sharp corners and minimal curves. This creates a sense of clarity and directness, making it ideal for headlines and branding where a bold statement is desired. The font's bold weight and geometric structure evoke a sense of power and authority, while the sharp corners and minimal curves suggest a sense of modernity and efficiency. It's a typeface that commands attention and conveys a sense of confidence and strength. While its bold nature makes it suitable for large-scale applications, it can also be used effectively in smaller sizes for digital interfaces and editorial design, adding a touch of boldness and personality to any project.",
