    "detailed_description": "Ashrud is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by strong, vertical strokes and sharp, angular terminals, giving the font a sense of confidence and authority. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. While the overall impression is modern and minimalist, subtle details like the slightly rounded corners of the lowercase 'a' and 'e' add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist details makes Ashrud versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence and clear readability make it suitable for headlines and titles, while its clean lines and contemporary feel make it equally effective for body text and UI elements. Ashrud's bold, geometric aesthetic evokes a sense of modernity and sophistication, suggesting a brand or project that is both confident and forward-thinking. Its clean lines and sharp angles also hint at a sense of precision and efficiency, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a sense of professionalism and authority.",
