    "detailed_description": "Gurunge is a display typeface that embodies the spirit of hand-drawn lettering, capturing a raw and energetic aesthetic. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by uneven strokes and exaggerated curves, create a sense of spontaneity and immediacy. The font's construction is based on a loose, gestural approach, with each letter appearing as if it were drawn with a single, confident stroke. This results in a highly expressive typeface that conveys a sense of personality and individuality. The uneven baseline and inconsistent letter spacing further enhance the hand-drawn feel, adding to the font's informal and playful character. Gurunge's bold and expressive nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its informal and energetic vibe aligns well with contemporary design trends, particularly in the realm of street art, graffiti, and DIY aesthetics. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from edgy branding to playful social media graphics, adding a touch of personality and authenticity to any project.",
