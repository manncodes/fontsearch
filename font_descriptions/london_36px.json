    "detailed_description": "London is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanist details gives London a versatile personality, capable of conveying both professionalism and a sense of contemporary style. Its clean lines and strong presence make it ideal for branding, web design, and editorial applications, particularly in contexts where clarity and a modern feel are paramount. London's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and innovation, aligning it with the values of forward-thinking brands and digital-native design.",
