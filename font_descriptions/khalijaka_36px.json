    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its isometric construction, giving it a distinct three-dimensional appearance. Each letterform is built from a series of connected rectangular blocks, creating a pixelated, almost blocky aesthetic. The consistent angle of the isometric projection adds a sense of dynamism and movement, while the sharp corners and clean lines contribute to a bold and assertive personality. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early video game graphics and 80s sci-fi aesthetics. This makes it ideal for projects that seek to capture a playful, nostalgic, or futuristic vibe, particularly in digital contexts like game design, web interfaces, or branding for tech-focused companies.",
