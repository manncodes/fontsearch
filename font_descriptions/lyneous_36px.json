    "detailed_description": "Lyneous is a geometric sans-serif typeface built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp corners, straight lines, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of precision and order. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of Lyneous is bold and confident, with a hint of retrofuturism. Its sharp angles and geometric forms evoke a sense of technology and progress, reminiscent of mid-century modern design. However, the font's clean lines and balanced proportions prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Lyneous is well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly where a strong visual identity and a sense of modernity are desired. Its bold presence and clear legibility make it effective for headlines, logos, and other prominent text elements. However, its geometric nature might limit its use in longer blocks of text, especially at smaller sizes.",
