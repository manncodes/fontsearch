    "detailed_description": "Drago's bold, expressive strokes and dynamic angles create a font that feels both hand-drawn and digitally refined. The irregular letterforms, with their exaggerated curves and sharp corners, evoke a sense of energy and spontaneity. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven baseline adds a touch of playful imperfection. This combination of technical precision and artistic freedom makes Drago's ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold, energetic personality is desired. Its hand-drawn aesthetic suggests a sense of authenticity and human connection, while its digital refinement ensures clean and consistent rendering across various platforms. Drago's evokes a sense of modern street culture, with its bold, graphic style reminiscent of graffiti and street art. It's a font that feels both playful and powerful, capable of adding a touch of rebellious energy to any project.",
