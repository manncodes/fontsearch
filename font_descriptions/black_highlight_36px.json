    "detailed_description": "Black Highlight is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, geometric construction and distinctive double-outline effect. The letterforms are clean and angular, with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The double outline creates a sense of depth and dimension, adding a playful and slightly retro feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale headlines and smaller body text. Its bold presence and playful nature make it ideal for eye-catching titles, branding elements, and digital interfaces, particularly those with a retro or futuristic aesthetic. The double outline effect adds a touch of whimsy and dynamism, while the geometric construction maintains a sense of order and clarity. Black Highlight evokes a sense of playful confidence, suggesting a brand that is both bold and approachable.",
