    "detailed_description": "Gamaliel is a bold sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from geometric sans-serifs of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary twist. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and sharp corners, giving it a strong and confident presence. However, the font incorporates subtle humanist details, such as slightly rounded terminals and a slight variation in stroke weight, which softens the overall impression and adds a touch of approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The bold weight and strong character make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display typography, while its contemporary feel makes it relevant for modern design projects. Gamaliel evokes a sense of confidence and authority, but with a touch of playfulness, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to digital interfaces.",
