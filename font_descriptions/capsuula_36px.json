    "detailed_description": "Capsulla is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Capsulla versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both print and screen. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a brand that is both modern and approachable, capable of conveying professionalism without sacrificing a sense of personality.",
