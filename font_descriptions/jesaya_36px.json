    "detailed_description": "Jesaya exhibits a clean, modern aesthetic built upon a foundation of geometric construction. Its uppercase letters are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals, lending a sense of precision and clarity. The lowercase letters, however, introduce a subtle humanist touch with slightly rounded terminals and a more organic flow, creating a balance between formality and approachability. This interplay between geometric structure and humanist detail gives Jesaya a distinct personality, making it feel both contemporary and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Its clean lines and neutral character make it a versatile choice for both corporate branding and editorial design, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile. Jesaya evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable, aligning well with contemporary design trends that prioritize clarity and accessibility.",
