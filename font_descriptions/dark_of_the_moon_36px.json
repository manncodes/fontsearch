    "detailed_description": "\u201cDark of the Moon\u201d is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The font's overall character is confident and professional, yet approachable and inviting. It evokes a sense of modern sophistication, reminiscent of minimalist design trends and the sleek aesthetics of contemporary technology. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial layouts and user interfaces. The font's clean lines and balanced proportions ensure readability across various screen sizes and resolutions, making it a reliable choice for digital environments.",
