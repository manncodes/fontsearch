    "detailed_description": "Les Etoiles is a calligraphic script font that blends classic elegance with a touch of playful whimsy. Its flowing strokes and graceful curves are reminiscent of traditional penmanship, but the font's overall structure is surprisingly modern. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The subtle variations in stroke weight and the gentle swashes add a touch of personality, making the font feel both sophisticated and approachable. Les Etoiles is well-suited for a variety of applications, from elegant invitations and branding to playful social media graphics and website headers. Its versatility stems from its ability to evoke both a sense of timeless charm and a contemporary spirit, making it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of both tradition and innovation.",
