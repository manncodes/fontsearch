    "detailed_description": "Aspergit is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its geometric construction and clean, modern aesthetic. The font's letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. The lowercase letters, particularly 'a', 'e', and 'o', exhibit a subtle humanist touch with slightly rounded terminals, adding a touch of warmth to the otherwise geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a font that is both legible and visually appealing. Aspergit's high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces and web design. The font's clean lines and minimalist design evoke a sense of efficiency and modernity, aligning it with contemporary design trends. Its versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and mobile applications.",
