    "detailed_description": "Insomnia is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its geometric construction, with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight, creates a sense of rigidity and strength. The font's distinctive feature is its heavily distressed texture, achieved through the application of a gritty, pixelated overlay. This texture adds a layer of visual noise, evoking a sense of wear and tear, as if the letters have been etched onto a weathered surface. The overall effect is one of grit and authenticity, suggesting a rebellious spirit and a disregard for conventional polish. While the geometric structure provides a sense of order, the distressed texture disrupts this order, creating a dynamic tension between structure and chaos. This tension makes Insomnia suitable for projects that require a bold, edgy aesthetic, such as branding for underground music, street art, or industrial design. The font's gritty texture can also be used to create a sense of urgency or danger, making it effective for warning signs, posters, or other applications where a strong visual impact is desired.",
