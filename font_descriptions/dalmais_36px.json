    "detailed_description": "Dalmais is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct Art Deco flair. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and precise angles, creating a sense of modernity and sophistication. The letterforms are characterized by a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a touch of boldness and dynamism. The overall effect is a font that is both elegant and powerful, capable of commanding attention without feeling overly aggressive. Its historical roots are evident in the Art Deco influence, particularly in the use of geometric shapes and the strong verticality of the letterforms. However, Dalmais also feels distinctly contemporary, with its clean lines and bold presence resonating with modern design sensibilities. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web and mobile interfaces. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other prominent text elements. However, its bold nature might not be suitable for large blocks of body text, especially at smaller sizes. Dalmais evokes a sense of confidence and sophistication, suggesting a brand or message that is both stylish and authoritative. Its geometric construction and bold presence create a sense of order and control, while the subtle curves and rounded corners add a touch of warmth and approachability.",
