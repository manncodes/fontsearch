    "detailed_description": "The font \"Andragogy\" exhibits a flowing, cursive style with a distinct hand-drawn quality. Its letterforms are characterized by graceful curves and subtle variations in stroke weight, creating a sense of natural movement. The ascenders and descenders are elongated, adding to the overall sense of fluidity. The font's design is reminiscent of traditional calligraphy, with a touch of contemporary flair. The slightly rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text applications.
