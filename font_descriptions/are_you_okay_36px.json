    "detailed_description": "This font, \"Are You Okay (36PX)\" by Khuraisan, embodies a dynamic and expressive script style, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering with a brush. The strokes are thick and fluid, exhibiting a clear sense of direction and energy. The letterforms are characterized by pronounced curves and angled transitions, creating a sense of movement and rhythm. The overall impression is one of casual confidence, with a touch of playful irreverence. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its informal yet polished aesthetic lends itself well to branding, social media graphics, and editorial design, particularly for projects that seek to convey a sense of authenticity and personality. The font's brush-stroke texture adds a layer of warmth and human touch, evoking a sense of handcrafted artistry. This, combined with its energetic character, makes it ideal for projects that aim to connect with a younger, digitally-savvy audience.",
