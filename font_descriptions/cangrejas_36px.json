    "detailed_description": "Cangrejas is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost whimsical spirit. Its organic, hand-drawn forms are reminiscent of children's drawings, with rounded edges and exaggerated curves. The font's construction is characterized by a lack of strict geometric precision, instead relying on a free-flowing, expressive approach. This results in a font that is both visually engaging and highly distinctive. The bold strokes and generous letterforms create a sense of energy and vibrancy, while the irregular spacing and uneven baseline add to its playful character. Cangrejas is best suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold, eye-catching statement is desired. Its unique personality makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy and a sense of fun. The font's cultural associations are rooted in a sense of childhood innocence and creativity, evoking a sense of nostalgia and playful energy.",
