    "detailed_description": "Font Bright Light FX by Vladimir Nikolic is a bold and playful display typeface that utilizes a distinctive 3D extrusion effect. The letters are constructed with a geometric foundation, featuring sharp corners and clean lines, giving them a modern and futuristic feel. The extrusion adds a sense of depth and dimension, creating a dynamic and eye-catching visual. The overall character of the font is energetic and playful, with a hint of retro nostalgia. It evokes a sense of fun and excitement, reminiscent of 80s arcade games or futuristic sci-fi films. The font's bold and graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other display applications where it can command attention. Its playful personality also makes it suitable for branding projects that aim to convey a sense of energy and innovation. While the 3D effect adds visual interest, it can be challenging to read in smaller sizes or when used in long blocks of text. The font's bold and graphic nature also makes it less suitable for body copy or other applications where readability is paramount.",
