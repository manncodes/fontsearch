    "detailed_description": "Komika Sketch is a playful, hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of casual creativity. Its 3D construction, achieved through a series of overlapping lines, gives it a distinct, almost childlike charm. The letters are slightly rounded and irregular, adding to the hand-drawn aesthetic. While the 3D effect adds visual interest, it can make the font challenging to read in smaller sizes, especially in dense blocks of text. Despite this, Komika Sketch's unique personality makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and playful branding projects, particularly in digital contexts where its informal charm can be effectively utilized. The font's playful nature and its association with hand-drawn aesthetics make it a good choice for projects targeting younger audiences or those seeking a fun and approachable visual style.",
