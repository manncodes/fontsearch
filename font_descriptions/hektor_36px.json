    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a striking geometric construction, with characters built from clean, vertical lines and sharp angles. The consistent stroke weight and minimal curves create a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist typography. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall character is bold and confident, conveying a sense of authority and clarity. Its starkness and geometric nature evoke a sense of futuristic technology, while the sharp angles and bold forms suggest a sense of power and control. This font would be ideal for headlines, branding, and interface elements where a strong visual impact and a sense of modern sophistication are desired.",
