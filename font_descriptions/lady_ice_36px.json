    "detailed_description": "Lady Ice is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean and modern appearance. The letterforms are characterized by sharp corners, bold strokes, and a consistent weight throughout. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters enhance its airy and contemporary feel. The font's overall character is bold and confident, with a touch of playful energy. It evokes a sense of futuristic optimism, reminiscent of 1980s science fiction and cyberpunk aesthetics. Lady Ice is well-suited for digital applications, particularly in headlines, branding, and user interface design. Its bold presence and clear readability make it effective for capturing attention and conveying a sense of innovation. However, its geometric nature might limit its use in extended body text, where a more humanist typeface might offer better readability.",
