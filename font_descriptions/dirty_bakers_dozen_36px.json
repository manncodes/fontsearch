    "detailed_description": "Dirty Bakers Dozen is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct stencil-like quality. Its construction is based on strong, angular shapes with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful irreverence. Its bold, graphic nature evokes a sense of street art and urban culture, reminiscent of hand-painted signage and graffiti. The font's strong visual impact makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts where a bold and edgy aesthetic is desired. Its stencil-like quality adds a layer of visual interest and a sense of immediacy, making it suitable for projects that require a strong visual presence.",
