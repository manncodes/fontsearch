    "detailed_description": "Elic Loves Biscuit is a playful and expressive script font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular letterforms, with their varying stroke weights and bouncy curves, create a sense of spontaneity and warmth. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The lowercase letters are particularly charming, with their whimsical ascenders and descenders, while the uppercase letters maintain a more consistent baseline, providing a sense of balance. The font's overall character is friendly and approachable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and handwritten notes. Its informal yet legible nature evokes a sense of personal connection, suggesting a brand that is authentic and relatable. The font's playful energy and casual aesthetic make it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to convey a sense of fun and creativity.",
