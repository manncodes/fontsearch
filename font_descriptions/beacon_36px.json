    "detailed_description": "Beacon is a script font that captures the energy of hand-lettering with a contemporary twist. Its flowing strokes and dynamic angles create a sense of movement and personality, while the overall structure remains legible and balanced. The font's brush-like texture adds a touch of warmth and authenticity, reminiscent of traditional calligraphy. However, the clean, modern construction and consistent stroke weights prevent it from feeling overly vintage or overly casual. This balance makes Beacon suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and website design. Its playful yet sophisticated character evokes a sense of creativity and approachability, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and visual interest.",
