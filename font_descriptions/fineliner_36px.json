    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and layered, almost 3D effect, evokes a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The letters are built from a series of parallel lines, creating a sense of depth and dynamism. The rounded corners and open counters contribute to a friendly, approachable feel, despite the font's inherent boldness. The consistent stroke weight and clean lines ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This makes it suitable for headlines, logos, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's retro vibe, reminiscent of 1970s science fiction and video game graphics, adds a playful and nostalgic element, making it ideal for projects that aim to capture a sense of retro-futuristic optimism.",
