    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong, geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and precise angles of its letterforms. The overall design is highly legible, with a consistent stroke weight and open counters that ensure clarity even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, contributing to a sense of boldness and authority. While the font's geometric foundation suggests a sense of order and precision, it's tempered by subtle humanist details, such as the slight curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', which add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric structure and humanist nuance creates a font that is both authoritative and inviting. Its practical applications are wide-ranging, from signage and branding to editorial design and digital interfaces. The font's bold presence makes it suitable for headlines and titles, while its legibility ensures readability in body text. Its clean, modern aesthetic aligns well with contemporary design trends, evoking a sense of efficiency and clarity. The font's strong, geometric structure suggests a sense of stability and reliability, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of approachability and warmth, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.",
