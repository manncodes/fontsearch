    "detailed_description": "Altera 30px is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent stroke weights. The font's distinctive feature is its use of square and rectangular shapes, creating a bold, almost robotic appearance. This is further emphasized by the absence of serifs and the minimal use of curves, resulting in a clean, uncluttered design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. Altera 30px exudes a sense of confidence and authority, making it suitable for projects that require a strong visual presence. Its futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of technological advancement and innovation, making it ideal for branding, web design, and digital interfaces. However, its starkness might limit its use in contexts requiring warmth or approachability.",
