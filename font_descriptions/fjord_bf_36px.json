    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, built entirely from triangles, circles, and rectangles. The sharp angles and stark contrasts create a strong visual impact, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist design. The consistent use of geometric shapes results in a highly structured and disciplined aesthetic, conveying a sense of order and precision. While the font's bold forms and minimal details make it highly legible at larger sizes, its lack of serifs and tight letter spacing can make it challenging to read in smaller point sizes. This font is ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual presence is desired, particularly in digital contexts where its geometric forms translate well to screen displays. The font's bold and assertive character evokes a sense of confidence and authority, making it suitable for projects that require a modern and impactful visual identity.",
