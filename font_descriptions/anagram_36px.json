    "detailed_description": "Anagram is a display typeface that blends geometric construction with playful, almost cartoonish details. Its bold, blocky forms are built on a grid system, creating a sense of order and stability. However, the font's distinctive character comes from its exaggerated curves and sharp angles, which add a touch of whimsy and energy. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines and branding elements. The font's playful nature is further emphasized by the inclusion of decorative flourishes on certain characters, such as the 'Q' and 'R', adding a touch of personality and visual interest. Anagram's bold, graphic style evokes a sense of retro nostalgia, reminiscent of 1970s and 1980s design trends. Its playful energy and bold presence make it suitable for projects that require a fun, attention-grabbing aesthetic, such as children's books, packaging, or digital interfaces.",
