    "detailed_description": "King Richard is a bold, italic typeface that blends classic serif construction with a contemporary, energetic feel. Its strong, slanted strokes and generous x-height create a sense of dynamism and movement, while the subtle bracketed serifs and slightly rounded terminals add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's overall structure is geometric, with consistent proportions and a clear hierarchy of strokes, but the slight variations in letterforms and the playful use of italics give it a unique personality. This combination of technical precision and expressive character makes King Richard suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its confident yet approachable nature evokes a sense of modern sophistication, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and grounded in tradition.",
