From the geometric precision of Audi's interlocking rings to the bold, stylized script of Ferrari's prancing horse, these logos employ a variety of techniques to convey power, luxury, and heritage. The use of bold, contrasting colors and simplified forms ensures high visibility and memorability, even at small sizes.
