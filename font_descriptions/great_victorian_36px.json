    "detailed_description": "Great Victorian is a display typeface that embodies the ornate aesthetic of the Victorian era. Its construction is based on classical serif principles, with a strong emphasis on decorative flourishes and intricate details. The letters are characterized by a high x-height, generous counters, and a distinct calligraphic flair. The serifs are often extended and embellished with delicate curves and swashes, adding a sense of elegance and grandeur. The overall impression is one of refined sophistication, with a touch of whimsical charm. While its historical roots are evident, Great Victorian also possesses a contemporary appeal, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of vintage elegance or a playful nod to the past. Its bold presence and decorative elements make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding materials, particularly in the fashion, beauty, and luxury industries. However, its intricate details may limit its legibility in smaller sizes or for extended body text.",
