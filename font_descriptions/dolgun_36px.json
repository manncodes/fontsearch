    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a stark, geometric construction, with each letterform built from precise, rectilinear shapes. The consistent width of the strokes and the sharp, unmodulated terminals contribute to a sense of rigidity and order. The overall structure is highly symmetrical, with a strong vertical axis and a consistent baseline. This creates a sense of balance and stability, while the lack of any curves or organic elements reinforces the font's austere and minimalist aesthetic. Despite its geometric foundation, the font avoids feeling cold or impersonal. The subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slight inward slant of the 'A' and the subtle curves in the 'S,' introduce a touch of humanity and prevent the design from becoming overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes the font suitable for a wide range of applications, from technical documentation and branding to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility ensure clarity and professionalism, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold. The font evokes a sense of modernism and efficiency, suggesting a focus on clarity, precision, and functionality. It resonates with contemporary design trends that value simplicity and minimalism, while also referencing the geometric aesthetic of mid-century modernism.",
