    "detailed_description": "Duality is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a subtle tension between geometric precision and humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a clear, almost architectural framework, evident in the consistent stroke widths and the precise angles of its letterforms. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through the introduction of subtle curves in the terminals and the slight variation in stroke weight within individual characters. This creates a visual balance that feels both modern and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. Duality's clean lines and balanced proportions evoke a sense of clarity and professionalism, while its subtle humanist touches add a touch of approachability and warmth. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a modern aesthetic without sacrificing readability or personality.",
