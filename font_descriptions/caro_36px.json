    "detailed_description": "Techno Square is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies the spirit of early digital design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly square letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The consistent stroke width and uniform spacing create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly condensed proportions add a touch of dynamism. The font's bold, assertive character is further emphasized by the absence of serifs and the use of a monospaced structure. This combination of technical precision and visual impact makes Techno Square ideal for projects that require a strong, modern aesthetic, such as website headers, app interfaces, and futuristic branding. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of computing, while its clean lines and sharp edges suggest a forward-thinking, innovative spirit. The font's digital origins are evident in its pixelated appearance, which adds a layer of texture and authenticity to its overall aesthetic.",
