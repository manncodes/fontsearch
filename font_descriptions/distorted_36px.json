    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric design, built on a foundation of sharp angles and contrasting thick and thin strokes. The letters are constructed with a distinct sense of depth, achieved through a series of parallel lines that create a layered effect. This layering, combined with the bold weight and sharp angles, gives the font a sense of solidity and power. The overall character is assertive and confident, with a touch of retro futurism. The font's design evokes a sense of technology and progress, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. It's a font that demands attention, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its bold nature and limited character set might make it less suitable for extended body text or delicate designs.",
