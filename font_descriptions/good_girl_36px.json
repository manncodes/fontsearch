    "detailed_description": "Good Girl is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its bold, chunky letterforms are built with a combination of geometric and organic elements, creating a unique visual language. The letters are characterized by their exaggerated proportions, with a high x-height and wide counters that contribute to its strong legibility, even at large sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly irregular outlines add a touch of whimsy, while the overall structure remains grounded in a sense of stability. This balance between playful and professional makes Good Girl suitable for a variety of applications, from eye-catching headlines and branding to playful illustrations and digital interfaces. Its bold personality evokes a sense of fun and energy, reminiscent of vintage cartoon graphics and contemporary street art, making it a versatile choice for projects that demand a bold and expressive visual identity.",
