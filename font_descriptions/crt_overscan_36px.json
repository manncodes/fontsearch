    "detailed_description": "CRT Overscan is a font that embodies the pixelated aesthetic of early digital displays. Its construction is based on a grid system, with each letterform composed of individual squares. This creates a distinct retro feel, reminiscent of classic video games and computer interfaces. The font's bold, blocky forms convey a sense of strength and clarity, while the slightly uneven spacing between characters adds a touch of playful imperfection. This combination of technical precision and visual irregularity makes it ideal for projects that require a nostalgic yet modern feel. Its bold weight and high x-height ensure legibility even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's pixelated nature evokes a sense of digital nostalgia, transporting viewers back to a time of simpler technology and boundless imagination.",
