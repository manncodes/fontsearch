    "detailed_description": "This font is a striking example of geometric sans-serif design, built upon a rigid grid system with sharp, angular terminals. The construction is highly disciplined, with each letterform meticulously crafted from a series of straight lines and right angles. This creates a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of architectural drawings or technical schematics. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. While the overall aesthetic is undeniably modern, the font's clean lines and minimalist approach also evoke a sense of timeless elegance, suggesting a connection to the Bauhaus movement and its emphasis on functional design. This combination of contemporary clarity and historical resonance makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces.",
