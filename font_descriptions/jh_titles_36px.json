    "detailed_description": "JH Titles is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letters are composed of sharp, angular strokes with minimal curves, creating a strong, assertive presence. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at small sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters contribute to a sense of clarity and readability. The overall character of the font is confident and modern, with a hint of retrofuturism. It evokes a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's technical limitations lie in its lack of stylistic alternates and limited character set, which may restrict its use in more complex typographic designs. However, its bold, geometric nature makes it a powerful tool for creating impactful visual statements in a variety of contexts.",
