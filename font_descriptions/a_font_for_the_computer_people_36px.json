    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms and sharp angles, evokes a sense of power and authority. The construction is clearly based on a grid system, with each letterform meticulously crafted for maximum impact. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The distinctive feature of this font is its use of sharp, angular terminals, which add a sense of aggression and dynamism. This design choice, combined with the overall boldness of the typeface, creates a strong visual presence that commands attention. While the font's technical execution is precise and clean, it also possesses a certain raw energy that makes it feel both modern and timeless. Its bold, assertive character makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual statement is desired. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the aesthetics of science fiction and cyberpunk, with its sharp angles and bold forms reminiscent of futuristic technology and urban landscapes. It also carries a hint of retro-futurism, recalling the bold graphic design of the 1980s and 1990s.",
