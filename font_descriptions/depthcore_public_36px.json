    "detailed_description": "Depthcore Public is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a stark, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, with each letterform composed of simple, rectilinear shapes. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive and uncompromising character. While the overall design is rigid and geometric, subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slight curves in the 'a' and 'o', introduce a touch of humanity and prevent the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. Depthcore Public's bold and assertive personality makes it suitable for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of power or authority. It would be effective in headlines, branding for tech companies, or even for creating a sense of futuristic dystopia in graphic design. The font's starkness and simplicity also lend themselves well to digital interfaces, particularly in user interfaces that prioritize clarity and functionality. However, its bold and angular nature might not be suitable for large blocks of text, as it could lead to fatigue for the reader. Depthcore Public's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the aesthetics of cyberpunk and dystopian fiction, evoking a sense of technological advancement and societal upheaval. It also reflects the contemporary trend towards minimalist design and the use of bold, geometric forms in digital interfaces.",
