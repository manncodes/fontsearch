    "detailed_description": "Comic Note Raw is a playful and expressive font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular letterforms, with their exaggerated strokes and uneven spacing, evoke the spontaneity of a quick sketch. The font's bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. While the overall impression is casual and informal, the font's carefully crafted details, such as the subtle curves in the terminals and the consistent weight distribution, suggest a level of intentionality. This balance between spontaneity and control makes Comic Note Raw suitable for a wide range of applications, from casual social media posts to eye-catching headlines. Its playful nature evokes a sense of fun and accessibility, while its underlying structure ensures readability and professionalism. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the DIY aesthetic of street art and graphic design, reflecting a contemporary appreciation for authenticity and individuality.",
