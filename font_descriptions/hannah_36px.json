    "detailed_description": "This font's bold, geometric construction evokes a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of early video game graphics or the minimalist aesthetic of 1980s sci-fi. The sharp, angular forms and consistent stroke weights create a sense of precision and order, while the slightly rounded corners soften the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly harsh or cold. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces, headlines, and branding where clarity and impact are paramount. The font's bold, assertive character suggests power, innovation, and a forward-thinking approach, making it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of cutting-edge technology or futuristic vision.",
