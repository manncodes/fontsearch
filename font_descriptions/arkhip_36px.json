    "detailed_description": "Arkhip is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and carefully balanced proportions add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile or cold. This balance makes Arkhip suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and contemporary aesthetic evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and human connection. Arkhip's versatility and balanced personality make it a strong choice for projects that require a modern, yet timeless design.",
