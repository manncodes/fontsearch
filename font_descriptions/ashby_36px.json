    "detailed_description": "Ashby is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The lowercase letters, however, feature slightly rounded terminals, softening the overall impression and adding a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Ashby a versatile character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. Its clean lines and neutral personality make it a reliable choice for corporate branding, while its subtle warmth allows it to be used in more personal contexts as well. Ashby's contemporary design evokes a sense of efficiency and modernity, while its subtle humanism suggests a touch of approachability and warmth, making it a versatile choice for a variety of projects.",
