    "detailed_description": "Fresco Stamp is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with a touch of humanist warmth. Its clean lines and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of approachability. The font's x-height is relatively high, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall design is balanced and harmonious, with a subtle playfulness evident in the slightly condensed letterforms. Fresco Stamp evokes a sense of modernism with a vintage twist, reminiscent of mid-century design but with a contemporary edge. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's bold and confident character makes it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility ensures readability in body text. Fresco Stamp's unique combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth makes it a compelling choice for projects that require a balance of sophistication and approachability.",
