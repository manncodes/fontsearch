    "detailed_description": "This icon set embodies the spirit of the 1960s counterculture, drawing heavily on the visual language of peace, love, and protest. The icons are crafted with a bold, graphic simplicity, often employing circular forms and strong silhouettes. The peace sign, a central motif, is rendered in various styles, each subtly distinct yet instantly recognizable. The heart, another recurring symbol, is depicted in a classic, rounded form, conveying a sense of warmth and affection. The use of bold, black outlines against a white background creates a striking visual impact, emphasizing the icons' message and making them easily legible even at small sizes. The set's overall aesthetic is both nostalgic and timeless, evoking a sense of idealism and rebellion that resonates with contemporary audiences. While the icons are rooted in a specific historical context, their themes of peace, love, and social change remain relevant and powerful today.",
