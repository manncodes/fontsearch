    "detailed_description": "Jim Thorpe is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic geometric sans-serifs, but with a distinct retro-futuristic twist. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, angular letterforms with a strong, confident presence. The letters are designed with a slight 3D effect, achieved through a subtle offset in the outlines, adding a playful dimension to the otherwise geometric forms. This offset creates a sense of depth and dynamism, making the font feel both modern and nostalgic. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's bold weight and strong character make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display purposes, while its retro-futuristic aesthetic adds a touch of personality and intrigue. Jim Thorpe evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of the golden age of science fiction and space exploration, while also feeling distinctly contemporary. Its playful yet confident nature makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a bold statement with a touch of retro charm.",
