    "detailed_description": "Fegan is a display typeface that blends a classic serif structure with a distinctly hand-drawn aesthetic. Its thick strokes and bold serifs evoke a sense of vintage printing, while the textured lines and slightly uneven letterforms add a touch of handmade charm. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at larger sizes, making it suitable for headlines, posters, and branding elements. The overall effect is one of warmth and approachability, suggesting a connection to traditional craftsmanship while maintaining a contemporary edge. Fegan's textured lines and slightly uneven letterforms create a sense of authenticity and personality, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of handmade charm. Its vintage-inspired design evokes a sense of nostalgia and history, while its bold and confident character makes it suitable for modern applications.",
