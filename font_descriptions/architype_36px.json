    "detailed_description": "Architype 36PX is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the architectural forms of the Art Deco era. Its sharp angles and clean lines create a sense of precision and modernity, while the subtle curves in the terminals add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is a font that is both sophisticated and playful, capable of conveying a sense of confidence and dynamism. Its strong geometric structure and bold weight make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual presence. However, its playful nature and subtle curves also make it suitable for more casual applications, such as website design and social media graphics. Architype 36PX evokes a sense of retro futurism, reminiscent of the optimistic spirit of the 1920s and 1930s, while also feeling fresh and contemporary. Its bold, geometric forms suggest a sense of progress and innovation, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of forward momentum.",
