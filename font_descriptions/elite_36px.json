    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters built from clean, precise lines and sharp angles. The overall structure is highly symmetrical, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke weights further enhance readability. While the geometric construction lends a sense of formality and professionalism, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in certain characters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes the font versatile, suitable for both corporate branding and digital interfaces. Its bold presence and clear readability make it ideal for headlines, logos, and signage, while its clean lines and modern aesthetic resonate with contemporary design trends.",
