    "detailed_description": "Bacto is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic modernist design and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, precise letterforms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to strong legibility, while the open counters and consistent stroke weights ensure clarity even at small sizes. The font's overall character is confident and modern, with a touch of playful energy. The sharp angles and geometric forms evoke a sense of precision and order, while the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform construction add a touch of humanity. Bacto is well-suited for a variety of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and bold presence make it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility and versatility allow it to be used effectively for body text as well. The font's contemporary aesthetic and digital-native feel make it a strong choice for projects that require a modern and impactful visual identity.",
