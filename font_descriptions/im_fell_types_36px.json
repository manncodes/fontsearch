    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in the precise construction of its letterforms. The uppercase characters are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and consistent appearance. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and a generous ascender height, contributing to a sense of stability and readability. The terminals are sharp and well-defined, adding a touch of formality and precision. The font's design personality leans towards a modern and minimalist aesthetic, with a subtle hint of retro influence. The geometric construction and clean lines evoke a sense of order and efficiency, while the slightly rounded corners and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between formality and approachability makes the font suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. The font's cultural resonance lies in its ability to bridge the gap between classic design principles and contemporary aesthetics. It embodies a sense of timeless elegance while remaining relevant to modern design trends. Its clean and uncluttered appearance aligns with the minimalist aesthetic prevalent in contemporary digital culture, making it a versatile choice for a variety of projects.",
