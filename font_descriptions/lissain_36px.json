    "detailed_description": "Lissain is a bold sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, vertical strokes and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals and bracketed serifs add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and generous ascenders and descenders ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both modern and timeless, confident yet approachable. Lissain's bold weight and strong character make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a clear and impactful visual presence is desired. Its versatility allows it to be used across a range of applications, from corporate communications to editorial design, evoking a sense of professionalism and sophistication without feeling overly formal.",
