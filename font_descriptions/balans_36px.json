    "detailed_description": "Balans is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its defining feature is the double-stroke construction, which creates a sense of depth and visual weight. The strokes are consistently parallel, resulting in a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The letterforms are generally rounded, with subtle curves softening the sharp angles, contributing to a sense of approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The font's overall character is confident and modern, with a touch of playfulness. It evokes a sense of energy and dynamism, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The double-stroke construction adds a unique visual element, making it stand out from more traditional sans-serif fonts. The font's versatility and bold personality make it a strong choice for projects that require a contemporary and impactful visual identity.",
