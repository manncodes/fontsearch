    "detailed_description": "Florence Sans SC is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent circularity of letterforms like 'O' and 'Q', provides a sense of order and clarity. The slightly condensed proportions, with a moderate x-height and open counters, contribute to its legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale headlines and body text. The subtle curves in the terminals, particularly noticeable in letters like 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Florence Sans SC a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and contemporary feel make it ideal for branding, web design, and digital interfaces, while its retro undertones evoke a sense of nostalgia and sophistication. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its availability in various weights and styles, allowing designers to create a cohesive visual identity across different projects.",
