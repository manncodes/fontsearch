    "detailed_description": "Bud Hand (36px) is a playful script font that captures the essence of casual handwritten typography. Its organic forms and fluid strokes create a sense of immediacy and authenticity, reminiscent of a personal note or a quick sketch. The font's irregular baseline and varying letter heights contribute to its natural, unforced aesthetic. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, the font maintains a degree of legibility through its clear letterforms and consistent stroke weight. This balance makes it suitable for a range of applications, from informal social media posts to branding projects that seek a friendly and approachable tone. The font's inherent warmth and personality make it particularly effective for conveying messages of joy, creativity, and personal connection.",
