    "detailed_description": "Butterbelly is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, rectangular shapes with minimal curves, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the font's bold and assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slightly rounded corners of the 'a' and 'o', prevent the font from feeling overly rigid. This subtle humanization adds a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark design. Butterbelly's bold and confident personality makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital signage. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, making it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to convey a sense of innovation and progress. The font's strong visual presence and clear legibility ensure that it will stand out in any context.",
