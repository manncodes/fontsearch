    "detailed_description": "Black Lives Matter Staten Isl (36px) by Don Lee is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly condensed, with minimal spacing between characters, creating a sense of density and impact. The x-height is relatively low, contributing to the compressed feel and emphasizing the horizontal strokes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. This combination of geometric precision and starkness gives the typeface a powerful and uncompromising presence, reminiscent of architectural lettering or signage. Its bold, no-nonsense style makes it suitable for headlines, posters, and other applications where a strong visual statement is desired. However, its condensed nature and lack of variation in weight might limit its use in extended text blocks, especially at smaller sizes. The font's bold, graphic style evokes a sense of urgency and directness, aligning with the powerful message it represents. It suggests a contemporary, urban aesthetic, reflecting the spirit of activism and social change.",
