    "detailed_description": "Costa Rica is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a bold, geometric aesthetic with a touch of playful humanity. Its construction is rooted in a strong grid system, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the precise alignment of terminals. The high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. While the overall impression is one of confident clarity, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions inject a sense of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and human touch gives Costa Rica a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence and clear readability make it particularly effective for headlines and titles, while its playful nature allows it to be used for more informal applications as well. Costa Rica's bold, geometric aesthetic evokes a sense of modernism and confidence, while its subtle human touch adds a layer of approachability and warmth. This combination makes it a versatile typeface that can be used to create a wide range of visual experiences, from sleek and sophisticated to playful and engaging.",
