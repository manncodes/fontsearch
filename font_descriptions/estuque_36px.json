    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of raw energy and unbridled creativity. Each letterform appears as if it were drawn with a thick marker, capturing the immediacy and spontaneity of freehand sketching. The irregular strokes, uneven widths, and exaggerated angles create a sense of dynamic movement, as if the letters are in constant flux. The font's rough edges and unfinished appearance contribute to its rebellious and edgy character, making it a perfect choice for projects that demand a sense of authenticity and unconventionality. While its legibility might be compromised in smaller sizes, its impact at larger scales is undeniable, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding elements that need to grab attention and convey a sense of raw power. The font's raw energy and rebellious spirit evoke a sense of youthful rebellion and a desire to break free from conventional norms, making it a powerful tool for expressing individuality and challenging the status quo.",
