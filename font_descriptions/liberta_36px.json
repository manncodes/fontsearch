    "detailed_description": "Font Liberta PX is a bold and striking sans-serif typeface that utilizes a double-shadow effect to create a sense of depth and dimension. The geometric construction of the letterforms, with their sharp corners and clean lines, contributes to a modern and confident aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The subtle variations in stroke weight, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of visual interest and prevent the design from feeling overly rigid. The overall effect is a typeface that is both visually impactful and highly functional, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to digital interfaces and signage. The double-shadow effect, reminiscent of early 3D graphics and retro video games, evokes a sense of nostalgia and playful energy, while the geometric construction and sharp lines suggest a modern and confident approach. This combination of retro and contemporary elements makes Liberta PX a versatile typeface that can be used to create a variety of moods and styles.",
