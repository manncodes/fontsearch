    "detailed_description": "Chi-Town (36px) is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1970s and 80s. Its construction is based on a grid system, with each letterform built from a series of straight lines and sharp angles. This creates a strong, confident visual presence, reminiscent of vintage signage and bold graphic design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, softening the geometric rigidity and creating a more inviting feel. Chi-Town's bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and fun, while its clean lines and sharp angles lend a modern edge. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of contexts, from vintage-inspired designs to contemporary digital interfaces.",
