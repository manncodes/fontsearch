    "detailed_description": "Beheaded is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by sharp angles and strong verticality, creating a bold and assertive presence. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and consistent stroke width contribute to its confident and commanding personality. While its geometric foundation evokes a sense of order and rationality, the subtle variations in letterform proportions and the inclusion of unique glyphs like the ampersand and exclamation point add a touch of personality and prevent the font from feeling overly rigid. Beheaded's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual impact and contemporary aesthetic make it a compelling choice for projects that require a sense of authority and modernity.",
