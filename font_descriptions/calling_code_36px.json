    "detailed_description": "Calling Code is a monospace typeface that embodies a clean, functional aesthetic. Its geometric construction, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The lowercase letters are designed with a slight humanist touch, adding a touch of warmth to the overall impression. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanism makes Calling Code feel both modern and approachable. Its fixed-width nature makes it ideal for coding, programming, and other technical applications, while its clean lines and strong legibility also make it suitable for editorial design, branding, and even display purposes. The font's overall character evokes a sense of efficiency and clarity, suggesting a digital-native design sensibility. It's a typeface that feels both timeless and contemporary, reflecting the evolving nature of technology and its impact on visual communication.",
