    "detailed_description": "By Starlight is a decorative font that combines a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a surprisingly legible structure. The letters are built with a bold, outlined style, featuring a distinctive pattern of small stars within the outlines. This pattern adds a whimsical touch while maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is one of lighthearted fun, reminiscent of vintage children's books or playful branding. While the star pattern might seem overly decorative, it's surprisingly versatile, adding a touch of whimsy to a variety of projects, from children's products to social media graphics.",
