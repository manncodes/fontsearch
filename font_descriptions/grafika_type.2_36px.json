    "detailed_description": "Grafika Type.2 is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost architectural, presence. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by sharp corners, straight lines, and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of order and clarity. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of modernity and precision, with a touch of retro charm. This font is well-suited for applications where a strong visual impact and clear communication are paramount, such as branding, headlines, and digital interfaces. Its geometric nature evokes a sense of structure and rationality, while its subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Grafika Type.2 embodies a timeless elegance, suggesting both the precision of modern technology and the enduring appeal of classic design principles.",
