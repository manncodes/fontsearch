    "detailed_description": "FutuRed is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and subtle humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a grid-based system, evident in the sharp, angular terminals and consistent stroke widths. This geometric foundation lends a sense of order and clarity, making the font feel both modern and timeless. However, the slight rounding of the terminals and the subtle curves in characters like 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, ensuring readability even at small sizes. This makes FutuRed suitable for a wide range of applications, from digital interfaces and branding to print materials and signage. Its clean lines and bold presence evoke a sense of confidence and innovation, making it a strong choice for projects that require a modern and forward-thinking aesthetic. The font's overall character suggests a balance between technological advancement and human connection, reflecting the contemporary desire for design that is both functional and engaging.",
