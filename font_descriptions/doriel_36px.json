    "detailed_description": "Doriel is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines of the letterforms. The overall structure is geometric, with a strong emphasis on verticality and a consistent stroke weight. However, the terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and softening the otherwise rigid structure. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a font that is both legible and visually appealing. The high x-height and open counters ensure readability, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The font's overall character is confident and professional, yet approachable and friendly. It evokes a sense of clarity and order, suggesting a modern and efficient approach. Its historical influences can be traced back to the geometric sans-serif fonts of the early 20th century, such as Futura and Erbar, but Doriel incorporates a contemporary sensibility, making it relevant for modern design projects. Its versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web and mobile interfaces. The font's clean and modern aesthetic makes it particularly well-suited for digital environments, where its legibility and visual appeal are essential.",
