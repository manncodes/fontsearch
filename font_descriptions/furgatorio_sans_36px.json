    "detailed_description": "Furgatorio Sans embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a subtle humanist touch. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural lines, evident in the straight stems and sharp terminals. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, while the open counters enhance readability even at smaller sizes. The font's personality is both confident and approachable, with a slight warmth introduced by the subtle rounding of the terminals. This balance evokes a sense of modern professionalism without feeling overly sterile. The font's historical influences are clear, drawing inspiration from the geometric sans-serif styles of the early 20th century, but it avoids feeling overly retro by incorporating contemporary design sensibilities. Furgatorio Sans is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for smaller text sizes as well. The font's overall impression is one of clarity, confidence, and a touch of understated elegance, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a modern, yet timeless aesthetic.",
