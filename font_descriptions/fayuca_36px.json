    "detailed_description": "Fayuca is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its bold, chunky forms are built with exaggerated curves and sharp angles, creating a dynamic and eye-catching visual. The irregular letterforms, with their uneven widths and varying heights, contribute to a sense of whimsy and informality. The font's construction is decidedly hand-drawn, with noticeable inconsistencies in stroke thickness and letter spacing, adding to its handmade charm. This casual approach makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and playful branding projects, where its bold personality can inject a dose of fun and energy. While its irregular nature might limit its use in extended text, Fayuca excels in short bursts, adding a touch of personality and visual interest to any design.",
