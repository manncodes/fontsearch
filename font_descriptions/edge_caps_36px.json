    "detailed_description": "Edge Caps is a geometric sans-serif typeface built entirely from straight lines and sharp angles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly structured and consistent appearance. The letters are composed of overlapping lines, creating a sense of depth and dimension. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to good legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, especially at smaller sizes. The overall character of the font is bold and confident, with a strong sense of modernity. It evokes a sense of precision and order, reminiscent of architectural drawings or technical diagrams. The sharp angles and geometric forms suggest a futuristic aesthetic, while the clean lines and consistent structure lend a sense of professionalism. Edge Caps is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold and modern aesthetic makes it particularly effective for digital interfaces, especially in web design and mobile applications. However, its geometric construction and lack of organic curves may limit its use in longer blocks of text, especially at smaller sizes.",
