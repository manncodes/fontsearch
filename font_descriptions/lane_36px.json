    "detailed_description": "The font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. Its high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the overall impression. The consistent stroke weight and balanced proportions create a sense of order and clarity, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The font's overall character is both modern and approachable, suggesting a balance between professionalism and approachability. It evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, reminiscent of the minimalist design trends of the late 20th century. This makes it well-suited for contemporary digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, where its clean lines and strong legibility contribute to a modern and sophisticated aesthetic.",
