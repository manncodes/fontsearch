    "detailed_description": "Future Rot is a bold, playful display typeface that combines a geometric construction with a distinct, almost cartoonish, character. The letters are built on a strong, consistent grid, with rounded corners and exaggerated curves that give them a sense of movement and energy. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at large sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters contribute to the overall sense of openness and readability. The font's personality is both playful and confident, with a retro feel that evokes the bold graphics of the 1970s and 1980s. It's a font that demands attention, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While its bold nature makes it less suitable for extended body text, it can be used effectively for short bursts of text, especially in digital environments where its playful energy can be fully appreciated.",
