    "detailed_description": "Lady Copra is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, giving it a strong, confident presence. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing it from feeling overly sterile. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric structure and humanist details makes Lady Copra versatile for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it feel welcoming and engaging. Lady Copra's design reflects a contemporary sensibility, drawing inspiration from the clean lines and minimalist aesthetics of modern design trends. It embodies a sense of clarity, efficiency, and accessibility, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a modern and professional feel.",
