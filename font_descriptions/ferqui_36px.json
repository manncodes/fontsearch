    "detailed_description": "Ferqui is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines of the letterforms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to strong legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, especially at smaller sizes. The terminals, while generally sharp, exhibit a slight rounding, adding a touch of warmth and softening the overall impression. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail gives Ferqui a distinctive character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality. Ferqui's contemporary aesthetic evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, aligning with modern design trends. It suggests a brand that is both innovative and trustworthy, capable of communicating complex ideas with simplicity and elegance.",
