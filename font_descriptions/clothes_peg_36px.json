    "detailed_description": "This font is a playful exploration of 3D letterforms, employing a distinct 'folded paper' effect. Each character is constructed with a series of overlapping planes, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. The exaggerated curves and rounded terminals contribute to a friendly and approachable aesthetic, while the uneven edges and slight distortions add a touch of whimsy. The font's bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. Its playful nature makes it ideal for children's books, packaging, and branding projects that require a touch of fun and personality. The font's retro-inspired design evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of 1980s cartoon graphics and playful video game aesthetics. It's a font that embraces imperfection and celebrates the joy of hand-drawn typography.",
