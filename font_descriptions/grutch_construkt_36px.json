    "detailed_description": "Grutch Construct is a geometric sans-serif typeface that blends a strong, modern aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its construction is primarily geometric, with characters built from circles, squares, and straight lines. This creates a sense of clarity and precision, particularly evident in the uppercase letters, which feature sharp corners and consistent stroke weights. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through the introduction of subtle curves in the lowercase letters, particularly in the terminals of 'a', 'c', and 'e'. These curves add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling cold or sterile. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale display applications and smaller body text. The font's bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its subtle humanist elements ensure it remains approachable and engaging. Grutch Construct evokes a sense of modernism and technological advancement, suggesting a balance between efficiency and creativity. Its clean lines and geometric construction align with contemporary design trends, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of personality and warmth.",
