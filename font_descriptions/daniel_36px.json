    "detailed_description": "Daniel is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its irregular letterforms and expressive strokes evoke a sense of spontaneity and personality. The font's construction is based on a loose, organic structure, with varying stroke weights and angles that contribute to its dynamic character. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is casual and friendly, the font's confident strokes and bold forms prevent it from appearing childish or overly whimsical. Daniel's versatility makes it suitable for a range of applications, from informal branding and social media graphics to playful headlines and handwritten notes. Its inherent energy and approachable personality make it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of human warmth and authenticity.",
