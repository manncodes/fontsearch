    "detailed_description": "Delta Heavy is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on sharp, angular forms with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The letterforms are built with a consistent width, creating a sense of uniformity and solidity. The terminals are often cut at sharp angles, adding to the typeface's aggressive and edgy character. The overall effect is a font that feels both powerful and imposing, with a distinct sense of industrial strength. This makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its bold nature and lack of subtle details might limit its use in extended body text, especially at smaller sizes. Delta Heavy evokes a sense of technological advancement and urban grit, reminiscent of cyberpunk aesthetics and futuristic sci-fi imagery. It suggests a world of advanced technology, towering structures, and a sense of power and control.",
