    "detailed_description": "Hieronimus is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise aesthetic. The letters are composed of straight lines and sharp corners, creating a strong and confident visual impact. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at small sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke weights contribute to its clarity and readability. While the overall impression is one of starkness and simplicity, the subtle variations in letterforms, such as the rounded terminals on lowercase letters, add a touch of humanity and prevent the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Hieronimus suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital signage. Its bold and confident character evokes a sense of modernity and technological advancement, making it particularly well-suited for projects that require a strong visual presence and a sense of authority. The font's clean lines and sharp angles also suggest a sense of order and efficiency, making it ideal for projects that require a clear and concise communication style.",
