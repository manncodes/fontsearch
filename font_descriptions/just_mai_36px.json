    "detailed_description": "Just Mai is a handwritten script font that captures the casual charm of everyday writing. Its flowing strokes and natural variations in letterforms evoke a sense of authenticity and warmth. The font's organic construction, with its subtle curves and angled connections, creates a sense of movement and energy. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is relaxed and informal, the font's carefully balanced proportions and consistent stroke weights maintain a sense of professionalism. Just Mai is well-suited for branding projects that require a touch of personality, such as invitations, social media graphics, and handwritten notes. Its casual yet refined aesthetic evokes a sense of approachability and connection, making it ideal for projects that aim to communicate warmth and authenticity.",
