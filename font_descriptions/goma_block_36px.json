    "detailed_description": "Goma Block is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp, angular forms with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The letterforms are designed with a consistent width, creating a sense of uniformity and stability. The bold weight and heavy stroke contrast contribute to its commanding presence, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Goma Block a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and display purposes, particularly in digital environments where its strong legibility and striking presence shine. The font's retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. It suggests a future that is both bold and optimistic, making it a compelling choice for projects that seek to convey a sense of innovation and progress.",
