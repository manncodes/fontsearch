    "detailed_description": "Doland is a bold sans-serif typeface that exudes a confident and modern aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and precise angles, creates a sense of order and clarity. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of approachability, softening the otherwise rigid geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Doland a versatile personality, capable of conveying both authority and approachability. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces, while its legibility and versatility allow it to function effectively in body text and even smaller sizes. Doland's contemporary design evokes a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a modern and impactful visual identity.",
