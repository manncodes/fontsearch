    "detailed_description": "Fat Cross 300x is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on simple, rectangular forms, with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, contributing to its strong legibility even at small sizes. The weight is heavy, with a solid, almost monolithic feel. The font's personality is assertive and confident, with a touch of industrial grit. It evokes a sense of power and authority, reminiscent of vintage signage and industrial design. Its bold, no-nonsense character makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its lack of versatility might limit its use in extended text blocks, especially at smaller sizes. The font's cultural associations lean towards a retro-futuristic aesthetic, suggesting a blend of vintage industrial design and modern digital culture.",
