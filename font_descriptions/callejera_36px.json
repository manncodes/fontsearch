    "detailed_description": "Callejera is a bold and playful display typeface that draws inspiration from geometric and Art Deco styles. Its construction is based on simple, geometric shapes, with each letterform composed of a limited number of curves and straight lines. This results in a strong, graphic aesthetic that is both eye-catching and easily recognizable. The font's distinctive features include its exaggerated proportions, with a high x-height and wide counters, and its use of sharp angles and bold curves. These elements contribute to its dynamic and energetic character, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While its geometric foundation gives it a sense of order and structure, the playful use of negative space and unexpected letterforms adds a touch of whimsy and personality. This balance between structure and playfulness makes Callejera a versatile font that can be used for a wide range of projects, from modern branding to retro-inspired designs. Its bold and graphic nature makes it particularly well-suited for digital applications, where it can be used to create eye-catching headlines and interfaces. However, its unique character and strong personality also make it suitable for print applications, especially for posters, brochures, and other materials where a strong visual impact is desired.",
