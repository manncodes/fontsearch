    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, with each letterform built from sharp angles and distinct edges. The consistent slant and bold weight create a sense of dynamic energy, while the open counters and generous x-height ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a confident and assertive personality, reminiscent of early digital graphics and retro video game aesthetics. This font is ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold character and retro vibe make it particularly well-suited for projects related to gaming, technology, and streetwear, adding a touch of rebellious energy to any design.",
