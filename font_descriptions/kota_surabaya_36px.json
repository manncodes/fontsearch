    "detailed_description": "This icon set employs a simplified, geometric style, prioritizing clarity and recognition over intricate detail. The shapes are primarily constructed from basic forms like squares, circles, and triangles, resulting in a clean and modern aesthetic. The use of bold, solid black fills ensures high visibility, even at small sizes. While the overall style is minimalist, subtle variations in form and arrangement add visual interest. For example, the lighthouse features a slightly rounded top, while the church has a more angular silhouette. This subtle playfulness prevents the set from feeling overly rigid or monotonous. The icon set's straightforward design makes it highly versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces to mobile apps and even printed materials. Its clean and contemporary feel aligns well with modern design trends, suggesting a sense of efficiency and accessibility. The overall impression is one of urban vibrancy, evoking a sense of community and interconnectedness.",
