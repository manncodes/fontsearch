    "detailed_description": "Ostro 867 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, angular letterforms with sharp terminals and consistent stroke widths. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility even at small sizes. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy. The design draws inspiration from 1980s sci-fi aesthetics, particularly the bold, geometric typography prevalent in film posters and video game graphics of that era. This retro-futuristic vibe makes Ostro 867 particularly relevant for contemporary projects that seek to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the digital age's early days. Its bold, confident nature makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's geometric construction and sharp terminals lend themselves well to large-scale applications, while its high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes. Ostro 867's cultural resonance lies in its ability to evoke a sense of futuristic optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of the early days of personal computers and the promise of a digital future.",
