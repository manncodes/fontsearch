    "detailed_description": "Kenney Space is a geometric sans-serif font that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, with each letterform composed of simple, angular shapes. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and defined, adding a sense of precision and clarity. The overall design is bold and confident, with a slight mechanical feel, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and futuristic sci-fi imagery. This font is well-suited for headlines, logos, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of technology and space exploration, while its clean and modern aesthetic makes it relevant for contemporary design projects. The font's bold and confident character suggests a sense of innovation, progress, and technological advancement.",
