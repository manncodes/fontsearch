    "detailed_description": "Litos Script exhibits a graceful, flowing character, drawing inspiration from traditional calligraphic forms while maintaining a contemporary sensibility. Its rounded letterforms and fluid strokes create a sense of effortless movement, reminiscent of handwritten script. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The subtle variations in stroke weight and the gentle curves of the ascenders and descenders add a touch of warmth and personality, making it feel approachable and inviting. While its calligraphic origins are evident, Litos Script avoids overly ornate flourishes, maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic that feels both timeless and relevant. Its versatility makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any project.",
