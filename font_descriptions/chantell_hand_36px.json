    "detailed_description": "Chantell Hand (36px) is a script font that captures the immediacy and personality of handwritten text. Its organic forms, with varying stroke weights and expressive letterforms, evoke a sense of casual authenticity. The font's irregular baseline and playful ascenders and descenders contribute to its dynamic and energetic character. While the overall impression is informal, the font maintains a degree of legibility, making it suitable for short text blocks or headlines. Its casual yet readable nature makes it ideal for projects that require a personal touch, such as social media graphics, handwritten notes, or branding for creative businesses. The font's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey authenticity and personality in a digital world often dominated by sterile typography.",
