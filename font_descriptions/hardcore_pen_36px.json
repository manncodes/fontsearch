    "detailed_description": "Hardcore Pen is a display typeface that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, gestural forms evoke the immediacy of marker or brush strokes, with noticeable variations in stroke weight and letterform construction. The font's bold, confident character is further emphasized by its generous x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at large sizes. While the overall impression is one of casual informality, the font's consistent baseline and well-defined letterforms suggest a degree of control and intentionality. This balance between spontaneity and structure makes Hardcore Pen suitable for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and branding elements to informal social media graphics and street art-inspired designs. The font's raw, expressive nature evokes a sense of authenticity and rebellious spirit, aligning it with contemporary subcultures and DIY aesthetics.",
