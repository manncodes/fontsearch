    "detailed_description": "Athletic Supporter is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic American signage and vintage sports graphics. Its geometric construction, with strong, vertical strokes and open counters, creates a sense of confident clarity. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives the font a timeless quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold weight and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding, while its vintage aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and authenticity. The font's versatility allows it to be used in both traditional and digital contexts, from printed materials to website designs, adding a touch of retro charm to any project.",
