    "detailed_description": "Cord Blood Exp is a display typeface that blends classic serif construction with a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its bold strokes and generous x-height create a strong visual presence, while the rounded terminals and exaggerated curves add a touch of whimsy. The font's geometric construction is evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines, but the subtle variations in letterforms, like the extended tails of the 'Q' and 'R', inject a sense of personality. This combination of structure and playfulness makes Cord Blood Exp suitable for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines to playful branding. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of vintage signage and comic book lettering, while its bold presence feels contemporary and energetic. The font's playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality, while its strong legibility ensures it can be used effectively in a variety of sizes and contexts.",
