    "detailed_description": "Ambiente Sostenible is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its geometric construction and bold, confident forms. The letters are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a touch of modernity and a sense of directness. The overall weight is bold, conveying a sense of strength and authority. While the geometric foundation lends a sense of formality, the slightly rounded corners of some letters, like 'a' and 'o', introduce a subtle warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Ambiente Sostenible versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence and clear legibility make it suitable for headlines and large-scale displays, while its approachable nature allows it to work well in body text and smaller sizes. The font's contemporary design evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, aligning with modern design trends and reflecting a digital-native aesthetic.",
