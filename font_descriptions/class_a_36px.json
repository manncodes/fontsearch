    "detailed_description": "PX Class A is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of playful energy. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural lines, with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight throughout. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The overall impression is one of confident clarity, yet the subtle curves in the terminals and the slight variation in letter widths add a touch of warmth and personality. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes PX Class A suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying a sense of modernity and professionalism, while its playful energy adds a touch of personality and approachability. The font's overall character evokes a sense of optimism and forward momentum, reminiscent of the design trends of the mid-20th century, yet with a contemporary edge that feels fresh and relevant.",
