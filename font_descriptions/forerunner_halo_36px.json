    "detailed_description": "This font's angularity and sharp edges immediately evoke a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of science fiction imagery and cyberpunk aesthetics. The glyphs are constructed with a strong geometric foundation, featuring sharp terminals and a consistent stroke weight that creates a sense of precision and order. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces and display applications. The font's bold and assertive character suggests power, innovation, and a sense of forward momentum, making it ideal for branding projects that aim to convey a sense of cutting-edge technology or futuristic vision. However, its starkness and lack of organic elements might limit its use in contexts requiring warmth or approachability.",
