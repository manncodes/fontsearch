    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and sharp, angular terminals, exudes a distinct sense of urban grit and contemporary edge. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a consistent and visually striking appearance. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of confident assertiveness, with a touch of rebelliousness. The font's bold character and strong visual presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and graphic design projects that demand attention. Its contemporary aesthetic aligns well with street art, urban culture, and digital media, suggesting a sense of energy and dynamism. While its bold nature might limit its use in extended body text, it excels in creating impactful visual statements.",
