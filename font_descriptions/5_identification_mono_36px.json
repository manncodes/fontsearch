    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, blocky forms and rounded corners, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost mechanical, curves and angles, creating a sense of order and precision. The generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a hint of playfulness in the rounded corners and the slightly exaggerated curves of certain letters. This font evokes a sense of the 1980s, with its association with early computer graphics and arcade games, but it also feels surprisingly contemporary, reflecting the current trend towards bold, geometric typography. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to digital interfaces and editorial design, particularly where a strong visual impact and a touch of retro charm are desired.",
