    "detailed_description": "Bertolt Brecht is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are constructed with clean, precise lines and open counters, creating a sense of clarity and legibility. The slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase letters, however, add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Bertolt Brecht suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for body text, while its subtle personality allows it to stand out in headlines and branding elements. The overall impression is one of confidence and approachability, suggesting a brand that is both modern and human-centered.",
