    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a stark geometric construction, with each letterform built from precise, rectilinear shapes. The consistent stroke weight and sharp corners create a sense of rigidity and order, reminiscent of early digital typography. The absence of serifs and the uniform height of lowercase letters contribute to a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. While the overall impression is one of starkness, the subtle variations in letter spacing and the slight curves in certain characters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of humanity and prevent the font from feeling overly cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from technical documentation and user interfaces to branding and editorial design. The font's clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of efficiency and clarity, suggesting a digital-native design aesthetic.",
