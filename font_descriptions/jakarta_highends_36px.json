    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, built from sharp angles and contrasting shapes. Each letterform is a series of interlocking triangles and rectangles, creating a sense of solidity and structure. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and angularity give it a commanding presence, suggesting power and authority. It evokes a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of early video game graphics or cyberpunk aesthetics. This font is ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold character and futuristic feel make it suitable for projects related to technology, gaming, or science fiction.",
