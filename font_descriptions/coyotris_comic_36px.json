    "detailed_description": "Coyotris Comic is a playful and expressive font that draws inspiration from classic comic book lettering. Its rounded forms and exaggerated proportions create a sense of energy and whimsy, while its slightly irregular construction adds a touch of hand-drawn charm. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's bold and confident character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements that require a strong visual impact. Its playful nature also makes it well-suited for children's books, comics, and other projects that require a lighthearted and engaging tone. The font's cultural associations with classic comic books and pop culture add a layer of nostalgia and familiarity, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects.",
