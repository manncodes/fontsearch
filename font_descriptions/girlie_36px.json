    "detailed_description": "Girlie is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its irregular letterforms, with their rounded edges and expressive strokes, evoke a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uneven baseline adds to its hand-drawn charm. The overall effect is one of youthful exuberance and casual friendliness, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and warmth. While its informal nature might not be suitable for formal documents, Girlie excels in branding, social media graphics, and playful digital interfaces, adding a touch of whimsy and approachability to any design.",
