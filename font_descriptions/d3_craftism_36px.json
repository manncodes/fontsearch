    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement in geometric typography, constructed entirely from a series of connected lines that form a three-dimensional, isometric illusion. Each letter is built from a consistent set of angled planes, creating a visually striking and unified aesthetic. The sharp corners and clean lines contribute to a sense of rigidity and precision, while the isometric perspective adds a dynamic and playful element. The font's bold character is further emphasized by the generous x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric structure and playful perspective makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of 80s sci-fi and video game culture, suggesting a playful and optimistic future. Its bold and distinctive style is well-suited for projects that aim to capture a sense of energy, innovation, and retro-inspired design.",
