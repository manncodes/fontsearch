The letterforms are characterized by a fluid, organic construction, with rounded terminals and flowing strokes that create a sense of movement and informality. The ascenders and descenders are moderate in length, contributing to a balanced overall appearance. While the font exhibits a distinct handwritten aesthetic, it maintains a level of consistency and clarity, ensuring readability even in smaller sizes. The slight variations in letterforms add a touch of personality and charm, making it suitable for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone. Its casual nature makes it ideal for branding, social media graphics, or personal projects where a handwritten touch is desired.",
