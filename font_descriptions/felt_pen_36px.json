    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Felt Pen\", embodies the casual, expressive quality of handwritten lettering. Its irregular, slightly wobbly strokes mimic the natural variation of a felt-tip pen, creating a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the rounded terminals and playful letterforms add a touch of whimsy. The font's overall character is friendly and approachable, suggesting a sense of informality and personal connection. It evokes the spirit of handwritten notes, doodles, and personal expressions, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of human warmth and authenticity. While its hand-drawn aesthetic might not be suitable for formal documents, it excels in digital contexts like social media graphics, website headers, and informal branding, where its playful personality can shine.",
