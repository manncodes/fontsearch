    "detailed_description": "Angry Chalk is a script font that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes, jagged terminals, and uneven spacing evoke the immediacy of chalk on a blackboard. The font's construction is intentionally imperfect, with variations in stroke weight and letterform consistency adding to its authentic feel. This deliberate imperfection creates a sense of spontaneity and personality, making it ideal for projects that require a rough-and-ready aesthetic. While the font's legibility is somewhat compromised by its irregular nature, it excels in conveying a sense of urgency and informality. Its cultural associations range from punk rock aesthetics to DIY street art, making it a powerful tool for expressing rebellious or unconventional ideas. Angry Chalk is best suited for short bursts of text, headlines, or graphic elements where its unique character can shine. It's particularly effective in digital contexts where its rough edges can add a layer of texture and authenticity to otherwise polished designs.",
