    "detailed_description": "Komika Hands is a display typeface that captures the energy and expressiveness of hand-drawn lettering. Its rounded, slightly irregular forms evoke the spontaneity of brushstrokes, creating a playful and approachable feel. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where visual impact is paramount. The exaggerated ascenders and descenders add to its dynamic character, while the slightly angled baseline suggests a sense of movement and energy. Komika Hands' playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy or a connection to contemporary digital culture, particularly in areas like social media, branding, and entertainment. Its bold, expressive character can also be used to create a sense of informality or approachability in more formal contexts.",
