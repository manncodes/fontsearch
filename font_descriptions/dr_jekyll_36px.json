    "detailed_description": "Dr. Jekyll is a display typeface that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its construction is entirely organic, with each letterform feeling like a single, expressive stroke. The thick, uneven strokes and dramatic variations in weight create a sense of immediacy and spontaneity. The font's personality is bold and assertive, with a touch of rebelliousness. It evokes the spirit of street art and graffiti, suggesting a sense of freedom and individuality. While its legibility is limited due to the highly stylized forms, Dr. Jekyll excels in short bursts of text, particularly in large sizes. It's ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to urban culture and the DIY aesthetic, making it a powerful tool for expressing a sense of authenticity and rebellion.",
