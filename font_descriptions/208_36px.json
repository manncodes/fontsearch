    "detailed_description": "This font, likely a display typeface, features a bold, blocky, and somewhat rounded style. The characters are thick and have a slightly compressed appearance, giving them a compact and impactful feel. The rounded corners and slight curves in some letters, like 'a' and 'o', add a touch of softness to the overall design, balancing the boldness. The font's overall structure is simple and straightforward, making it easy to read, even at smaller sizes.",
