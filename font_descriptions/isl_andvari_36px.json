    "detailed_description": "ISL Andvari is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The terminals are often truncated, creating a clean, uncluttered appearance. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is bold and confident, with a hint of playful energy. It evokes a sense of technological advancement and futuristic design, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi films and video games. Its strong, geometric forms and clean lines make it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a sense of modernity and technological sophistication is desired. The font's retro-futuristic vibe also makes it a compelling choice for projects related to science fiction, gaming, and technology.",
