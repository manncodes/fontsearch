    "detailed_description": "Altea is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet sophisticated spirit. Its defining characteristic is the double-stroke construction, creating a bold, almost three-dimensional effect. The strokes are meticulously crafted with subtle variations in thickness, adding visual interest and depth. The overall proportions are generous, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at large sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed letterforms contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, while the consistent weight and clean lines maintain a sense of professionalism. Altea's versatility shines in its ability to adapt to various applications, from eye-catching headlines and branding elements to playful illustrations and digital interfaces. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and vintage charm, while its clean lines and modern execution make it feel fresh and contemporary. The font's playful nature invites experimentation and creative exploration, making it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of personality and visual impact.",
