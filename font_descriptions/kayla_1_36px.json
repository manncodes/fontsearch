    "detailed_description": "Kayla is a display typeface that embodies a playful, hand-drawn aesthetic. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by rounded corners and exaggerated strokes, evoke the spontaneity of marker or brush pen writing. The font's generous x-height and open counters contribute to its legibility, even at larger sizes. While the overall construction is informal, Kayla exhibits a careful balance in its proportions and relationships, ensuring a consistent visual rhythm across the alphabet. This balance, combined with the font's inherent energy, makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from eye-catching headlines and playful branding to informal social media graphics and quirky illustrations. Kayla's hand-drawn quality evokes a sense of authenticity and warmth, suggesting a personal touch and a connection to the human element. It resonates with contemporary trends in design that embrace imperfection and individuality, offering a refreshing alternative to more polished and formal typefaces.",
