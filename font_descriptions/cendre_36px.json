    "detailed_description": "Cendre is a geometric sans-serif typeface that balances a strong, modern aesthetic with a touch of playful personality. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, evident in the sharp corners and consistent stroke widths. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals, while geometrically defined, feature subtle rounding that softens the overall impression, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Cendre a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for bold headlines, clean interfaces, or even playful branding, offering a contemporary feel without sacrificing readability. The font's bold, confident presence evokes a sense of modernism and technological advancement, while the subtle rounding suggests a touch of approachability and warmth. This duality makes Cendre a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of strength and personality.",
