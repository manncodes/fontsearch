    "detailed_description": "Bold Type is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on precise, almost pixelated, squares and rectangles, giving it a clean, uncluttered aesthetic. The letterforms are bold and heavy, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. This combination of geometric precision and bold weight creates a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's bold, almost aggressive nature evokes a sense of urban energy and contemporary design, reminiscent of early digital graphics and the rise of street art. Its sharp edges and bold forms suggest a sense of defiance and individuality, making it a powerful tool for expressing a modern, edgy aesthetic.",
