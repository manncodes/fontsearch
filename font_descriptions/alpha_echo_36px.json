    "detailed_description": "Alpha Echo is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a rugged, hand-drawn quality. Its rounded, geometric letterforms are reminiscent of early digital fonts, but the uneven, textured outlines give it a distinctly handmade feel. This combination creates a unique visual tension, balancing a sense of whimsy with a touch of grit. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at larger sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. Its informal character and playful energy make it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of approachability. However, its bold, graphic nature might not be suitable for extended body text or more formal applications.",
