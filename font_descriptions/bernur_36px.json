    "detailed_description": "Bernur is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Bernur a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. Bernur's contemporary design language feels both timeless and relevant, making it a strong choice for projects that require a clean, modern aesthetic without sacrificing personality.",
