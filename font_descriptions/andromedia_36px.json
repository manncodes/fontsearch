    "detailed_description": "This font, with its sharp, geometric construction, evokes a sense of digital precision and futuristic energy. The letterforms are built from a series of angled lines and sharp corners, creating a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. The consistent use of diagonal strokes and the absence of rounded terminals contribute to the font's bold, angular character. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital displays and print applications. The font's bold, angular character and futuristic aesthetic make it ideal for projects that require a sense of dynamism and technological advancement. It could be used for branding, web design, or even futuristic interfaces, adding a touch of cyberpunk flair to any project.",
