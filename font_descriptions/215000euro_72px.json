    "detailed_description": "This font, likely named \"2115000\", is a bold, sans-serif typeface with a distinct grunge aesthetic. The letters are designed with a rough, torn, and distressed look, giving the impression of being cut out from a larger surface. This effect is achieved through jagged edges, uneven lines, and a subtle texture that mimics the look of paper or fabric. The font's overall appearance is bold and impactful, with a strong sense of energy and movement. The letters are generally wide and squat, contributing to the font's bold and assertive character.",
