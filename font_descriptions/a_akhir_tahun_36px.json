    "detailed_description": "Aakhir Tahun is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, contributing to a dense and impactful visual. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's bold weight and consistent stroke width give it a commanding presence, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the edges, adding a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Aakhir Tahun versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it ideal for conveying authority and confidence, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly cold or sterile. The font's contemporary aesthetic evokes a sense of modernism and digital culture, making it a fitting choice for projects that require a clean, impactful, and forward-thinking visual identity.",
