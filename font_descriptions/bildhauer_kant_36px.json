    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a bold, geometric construction with a strong emphasis on verticality. The letterforms are composed of clean, sharp lines and angles, creating a sense of precision and order. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance readability. The overall character is assertive and confident, with a touch of industrial strength. The font's design evokes a sense of modernism and functionality, reminiscent of early 20th-century architectural styles. Its bold, geometric forms suggest a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and signage. However, its clean lines and strong legibility also make it adaptable for digital interfaces and user experiences, particularly in applications where clarity and impact are paramount.",
