    "detailed_description": "Fluoride Beings is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct angularity. Its construction is based on sharp, almost brutalist, geometric shapes, with each letterform built from a series of angled planes. This creates a strong, assertive presence, particularly in uppercase, where the sharp corners and dramatic angles dominate. The lowercase, while still geometric, exhibits a slightly more rounded and approachable feel, with softened terminals and a less aggressive overall presence. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The bold weight and assertive character lend it a sense of power and authority, making it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its geometric nature and lack of serifs can feel somewhat cold or impersonal in extended text, making it more suitable for short bursts of text or impactful headlines.",
