    "detailed_description": "Decoy is a sans-serif typeface that balances a clean, geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its open counters and high x-height contribute to excellent legibility, particularly at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in letters like 'a' and 'g' add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This combination of geometric precision and humanist nuance gives Decoy a contemporary feel, suggesting a balance between efficiency and approachability. It's a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for both large-scale displays and small-scale text, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for a variety of contexts.",
