    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and geometric sans-serif, built on a grid-based structure with sharp, angular terminals. The consistent stroke weight and uniform letterforms create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly condensed proportions add a touch of dynamism. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is confident and assertive, evoking a sense of modernism and efficiency. Its clean lines and sharp angles suggest a digital-native design, making it ideal for headlines, branding, and user interfaces. The font's bold presence and clear readability make it suitable for both print and digital applications, particularly in situations where a strong visual impact is desired.",
