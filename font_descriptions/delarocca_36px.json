    "detailed_description": "Delarocca is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost architectural, character. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in precise angles and sharp terminals. The letterforms are composed of straight lines and sharp corners, creating a sense of rigidity and order. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of clarity and precision, with a touch of coldness that can be both intriguing and intimidating. Delarocca's sharp angles and geometric construction evoke a sense of modernity and technology, making it suitable for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. However, its starkness might limit its use in contexts requiring warmth or approachability. The font's bold, geometric nature suggests a sense of authority and power, making it ideal for projects that demand a strong visual presence. It could be used to convey a sense of innovation, efficiency, and even a touch of futuristic ambition.",
