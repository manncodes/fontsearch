    "detailed_description": "Euro Caps is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of humanist warmth. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural proportions, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, unornamented terminals. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. This clarity is further enhanced by the subtle curves introduced in the terminals of letters like 'C' and 'G', adding a touch of approachability to the otherwise rigid structure. The overall effect is a font that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying a sense of professionalism and confidence without appearing cold or sterile. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of order and clarity, suggesting a brand that is reliable, trustworthy, and forward-thinking.",
