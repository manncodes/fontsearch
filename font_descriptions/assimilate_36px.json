    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, multi-layered construction. Each letterform is composed of multiple parallel strokes, creating a striking visual depth and a sense of solidity. The strokes are slightly rounded, softening the overall impression and preventing a purely geometric feel. This combination of bold structure and subtle curves gives the font a unique personality, balancing a sense of strength and approachability. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's bold, layered design evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics and early computer graphics. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to capture a sense of technological innovation and futuristic optimism.",
