    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and pronounced 3D extrusion, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular shapes with consistent proportions. The extrusion effect, achieved through parallel lines and subtle shadowing, adds a sense of depth and dynamism. While the overall design is decidedly geometric, the slight rounding of corners and the subtle variations in letterform widths inject a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes it suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to futuristic interfaces and game design. The font's strong visual presence and retro-futuristic vibe evoke a sense of nostalgia for the technological optimism of the 1980s and 1990s, while its clean lines and modern construction ensure its relevance in contemporary digital contexts.",
