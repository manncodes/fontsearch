    "detailed_description": "Coolly Font (36px) is a playful script typeface that embodies a casual, almost childlike energy. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by rounded strokes and playful flourishes, create a sense of spontaneity and whimsy. The font's construction is loose and organic, with varying stroke weights and inconsistent letter spacing, adding to its informal charm. While the overall design is whimsical, the font maintains a degree of legibility, making it suitable for short bursts of text or headlines. Its informal nature makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as children's books, social media graphics, or branding for creative businesses. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to hand-drawn lettering and the DIY aesthetic, evoking a sense of authenticity and personal expression.",
