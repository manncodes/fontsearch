    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its precise construction and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of clean, angular strokes with sharp terminals, creating a sense of clarity and order. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall weight is medium, striking a balance between boldness and refinement. While the geometric structure provides a sense of formality, the subtle curves in the terminals and the slight variation in stroke thickness add a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanism gives the font a contemporary feel, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. The font's clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of modern aesthetics and timeless appeal.",
