    "detailed_description": "Curly Coryphaeus is a playful script font characterized by its exaggerated curves, whimsical flourishes, and a distinct hand-drawn aesthetic. The letterforms are constructed with a combination of rounded and angular strokes, creating a dynamic and energetic feel. The generous use of swashes and embellishments adds to the font's playful personality, while the overall structure remains legible and easy to read. The font's casual and informal tone makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy and charm, such as children's books, invitations, and social media graphics. Its hand-drawn quality evokes a sense of warmth and authenticity, making it suitable for projects that aim to connect with an audience on a personal level. However, its highly decorative nature may limit its use in formal or professional contexts.",
