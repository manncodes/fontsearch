    "detailed_description": "This font is a fascinating blend of geometric precision and subtle humanist warmth. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines of the letterforms. The terminals, however, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability that softens the otherwise stark geometric structure. This balance between order and organic detail creates a unique character, making the font feel both modern and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from digital interfaces to print publications. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of clarity and confidence, suggesting professionalism without being overly formal. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, modern look with a touch of human warmth.",
