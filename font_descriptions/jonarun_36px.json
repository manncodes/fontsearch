    "detailed_description": "Jonarun displays a confident, geometric structure with a subtle humanist touch. Its construction is based on clear, defined strokes with a consistent weight, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to strong legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, especially at smaller sizes. The terminals, though sharp, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and preventing a harsh, overly rigid feel. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Jonarun a modern, clean aesthetic that feels both professional and approachable. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines and body text, while its contemporary feel aligns well with modern design trends. Jonarun's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and clarity, suggesting a brand or message that is both reliable and forward-thinking.",
