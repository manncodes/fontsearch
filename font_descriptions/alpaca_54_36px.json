    "detailed_description": "Alpaca 5+ is a display typeface that embodies the raw energy of graffiti art. Its construction is characterized by bold, angular strokes with exaggerated serifs and dramatic, uneven letterforms. The font's irregular outlines and jagged edges create a sense of immediacy and spontaneity, reminiscent of hand-painted lettering. The high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at large sizes, while the overall chaotic aesthetic adds a rebellious and edgy feel. Alpaca 5+ is designed for impact, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding projects that demand attention. Its bold personality and raw energy make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of rebellion, street culture, and urban grit.",
