    "detailed_description": "Lintel is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism is further emphasized by the moderate x-height and open counters, which ensure excellent legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Lintel is confident and professional, yet approachable and inviting. It draws inspiration from the minimalist design trends of the mid-20th century, but its clean lines and versatility make it equally relevant in contemporary digital contexts. Lintel's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and web typography. Its clean lines and strong legibility ensure it performs well in both print and digital media, while its subtle warmth makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality.",
