    "detailed_description": "Cabrion is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural proportions of its letterforms, particularly in the uppercase. The terminals, however, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism is further emphasized by the font's high x-height, which contributes to its legibility and makes it suitable for both large-scale headlines and smaller body text. The overall impression is one of clarity and confidence, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. Cabrion's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and modernity, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and user-friendliness. This combination makes it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of sophistication and accessibility.",
