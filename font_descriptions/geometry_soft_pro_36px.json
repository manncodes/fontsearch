    "detailed_description": "Geometry Soft Pro is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist touches. Its forms are primarily based on circles and squares, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions, however, introduce a sense of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The font's overall character is confident yet friendly, suggesting a balance between professionalism and approachability. It evokes a sense of modernism, drawing inspiration from mid-century design trends while remaining relevant for contemporary digital interfaces. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and web design to editorial and signage.",
