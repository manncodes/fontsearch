    "detailed_description": "Bogotana is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Bogotana a versatile personality, suitable for a range of applications. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. Its bold weight and confident presence make it suitable for headlines and branding elements, while its clean lines and neutral character allow it to blend seamlessly into various design contexts. Bogotana's retro influence evokes a sense of mid-century optimism and technological advancement, while its contemporary design language ensures its relevance in today's digital landscape.",
