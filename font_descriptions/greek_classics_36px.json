    "detailed_description": "Greek Classics embodies a classic sans-serif aesthetic with a contemporary edge. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, provides a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the starkness, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that feels both modern and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. Its versatility is further enhanced by the inclusion of a comprehensive character set, including numerals, punctuation, and symbols, ensuring its adaptability across various design projects. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, evoking a sense of professionalism and trustworthiness, while remaining approachable and engaging.",
