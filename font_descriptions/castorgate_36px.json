    "detailed_description": "Castorgate is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'c', add a touch of approachability, softening the otherwise rigid geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Castorgate versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and efficiency, while the subtle warmth of the rounded terminals prevents it from feeling overly sterile. Castorgate's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of punctuation marks and symbols, making it suitable for both text and display purposes.",
