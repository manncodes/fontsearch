    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, rough-hewn strokes and distinct, almost stencil-like quality, evokes a sense of raw, unrefined energy. The letterforms are constructed with a clear, almost geometric approach, but the uneven edges and subtle variations in stroke width give them a hand-crafted feel. This combination of precision and imperfection creates a unique visual tension, suggesting both strength and vulnerability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its rugged character lends itself to projects that require a sense of authenticity, grit, or a touch of rebellion. The font's cultural associations range from industrial design and street art to vintage signage and DIY aesthetics, making it a versatile choice for projects that seek to capture a specific mood or era.",
