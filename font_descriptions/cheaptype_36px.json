    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and dynamic display typeface with a strong geometric foundation. Its characters are constructed with sharp angles and distinct, almost pixelated, edges, giving it a distinctly digital aesthetic. The extreme slant of the letters adds a sense of speed and energy, while the consistent stroke weight and open counters ensure good legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a hint of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early video game graphics or science fiction imagery from the 1980s. This font is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold personality and digital-native feel make it ideal for projects that require a sense of energy, innovation, and futuristic appeal.",
