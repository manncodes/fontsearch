    "detailed_description": "Andala is a sans-serif typeface that balances a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are generally rectangular, with sharp corners and a strong vertical emphasis. However, the terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall impression. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Andala a unique character, making it feel both modern and approachable. The high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from body text to headlines. The font's clean and uncluttered design makes it ideal for digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for branding and editorial projects. Andala's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, confidence, and modernity, making it a versatile choice for contemporary design projects.",
