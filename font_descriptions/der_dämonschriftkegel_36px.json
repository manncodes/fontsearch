    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a raw, expressive energy, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, gestural strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The bold, confident strokes are punctuated by sharp, jagged terminals, adding a touch of grit and rebelliousness. The overall effect is a dynamic, energetic typeface that feels both playful and powerful. While the font's construction is inherently organic, it maintains a degree of legibility, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications. The font's rough, hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of DIY culture and underground art, suggesting a rebellious spirit and a rejection of conventional norms. It's a font that speaks to the creative energy of individuals and the power of self-expression.",
