    "detailed_description": "Artisan is a sans-serif typeface that blends a clean, geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to its high legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Artisan a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to editorial design. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch. Artisan's versatility and contemporary feel make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of clarity, approachability, and sophistication.",
