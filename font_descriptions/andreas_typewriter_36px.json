    "detailed_description": "Andreas Typewriter [36px] is a font that captures the charm and character of vintage typewriters. Its construction is based on a classic serif design, with strong, geometric strokes and a distinct, slightly uneven baseline. The letterforms are characterized by a consistent weight and a subtle, almost playful, irregularity in their execution. This irregularity, reminiscent of the imperfections of vintage typewriters, adds a touch of warmth and personality to the font. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text. Its vintage aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and authenticity, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of retro charm. The font's playful nature also makes it suitable for branding and packaging that aims to convey a sense of fun and approachability.",
