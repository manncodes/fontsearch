    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its consistent, almost architectural construction. The letterforms are composed of clean, sharp lines and angles, creating a sense of precision and order. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall proportions are balanced and harmonious, with a slight emphasis on the vertical axis, lending a sense of stability and formality. The terminals are sharp and well-defined, adding to the font's crispness and modern feel. The font's design personality is characterized by its confident and assertive nature. It evokes a sense of authority and professionalism, reminiscent of classic sans-serif designs like Futura or Helvetica. However, it avoids being overly sterile or cold, thanks to subtle humanist details like the slightly rounded corners on some letterforms. This touch of warmth makes it suitable for a wider range of applications, from corporate branding to editorial design. The font's practical contexts include use in headlines, logos, and branding materials, where its strong presence and clear legibility are assets. It also performs well in digital interfaces, particularly for web design and mobile applications, where its clean lines and sharp edges translate well to screen resolutions. The font's cultural intuition suggests a connection to modernism and the pursuit of clarity and efficiency. It evokes a sense of order and control, reflecting the values of contemporary design and technology. Its clean lines and geometric construction align with the aesthetic of minimalist design, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of approachability and warmth.",
