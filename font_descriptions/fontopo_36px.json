    "detailed_description": "Fontopo is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that exudes a playful yet confident personality. Its construction is based on simple, rounded forms with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines. The letterforms are highly legible, with open counters and a generous x-height, making them easily readable even at small sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Fontopo versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to playful digital interfaces and signage. Its strong visual presence and playful nature evoke a sense of modern optimism and energy, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a bold and engaging visual identity. The font's bold weight and geometric construction also lend themselves well to large-scale applications, such as outdoor signage or display graphics, where its strong presence can be easily noticed.",
