    "detailed_description": "Doris PP is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its construction is characterized by clean, precise lines and a consistent stroke weight, giving it a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the geometric rigidity, adding a touch of warmth and personality. This balance between structure and softness is further emphasized by the font's high x-height and open counters, which contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. Doris PP's overall character is confident and friendly, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its versatility stems from its ability to convey both professionalism and approachability, making it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of clarity and warmth. The font's contemporary relevance is evident in its clean lines and digital-friendly design, while its subtle humanist details evoke a sense of tradition and craftsmanship. This combination of modern and classic elements makes Doris PP a timeless choice for projects that seek to communicate both innovation and trustworthiness.",
