    "detailed_description": "El Diablo is a bold, gothic-inspired typeface that blends sharp, angular forms with subtle humanist details. Its construction is primarily geometric, with a strong emphasis on verticality and a consistent stroke weight throughout. The letterforms are characterized by sharp, pointed terminals and a high x-height, creating a sense of power and authority. However, the slight rounding of the terminals and the subtle curves in some letters, like the 'a' and 'o', add a touch of approachability and prevent the font from feeling overly harsh. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives El Diablo a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. While its bold presence and gothic aesthetic might suggest a dark or sinister tone, the subtle humanist details and overall legibility prevent it from feeling overly menacing. El Diablo is well-suited for headlines, branding, and display typography, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact and a touch of mystery are desired. Its sharp angles and bold presence make it effective for large-scale applications, while its legibility and subtle humanist details ensure readability even at smaller sizes.",
