    "detailed_description": "F-Rotten is a display typeface that embodies a raw, distressed aesthetic. Its characters are built with a combination of geometric and organic elements, resulting in a unique blend of structure and chaos. The font's defining feature is its heavily distressed texture, achieved through the application of a grunge effect. This texture, while visually striking, can impact legibility, particularly at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of rebellion and grit. It draws inspiration from punk rock aesthetics and the DIY spirit of underground culture. F-Rotten is best suited for headlines, logos, and short bursts of text where its visual impact can be maximized. Its distressed nature makes it ideal for projects that require a raw, edgy, or rebellious feel, such as punk rock posters, street art designs, or edgy fashion brands.",
