    "detailed_description": "Bhangra is a bold, decorative display font that draws inspiration from traditional Indian folk art. Its chunky, geometric letterforms are punctuated by intricate, almost tribal-like patterns carved into each character. This unique combination creates a visually striking and culturally rich aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and branding elements. The intricate patterns, reminiscent of traditional Indian textiles and wood carvings, add a layer of visual interest and cultural depth, making it suitable for projects that celebrate cultural heritage or seek a unique, eye-catching design. While its bold nature makes it less suitable for extended body text, Bhangra's playful and energetic character makes it perfect for adding a touch of whimsy and cultural flair to any design.",
