    "detailed_description": "Fast Money is a bold, geometric sans-serif font constructed entirely from square modules. Each letterform is built by arranging these modules in a grid-like structure, creating a distinctly digital aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The sharp, angular terminals and consistent stroke widths contribute to a sense of rigidity and precision, evoking a sense of order and efficiency. This font's stark, unornamented design speaks to a contemporary digital culture, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and pixelated graphics. Its bold presence and clear legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong, assertive visual identity is desired.",
