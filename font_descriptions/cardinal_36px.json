    "detailed_description": "Cardinal (36px) is a blackletter typeface that blends historical inspiration with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction draws heavily from medieval Gothic scripts, featuring sharp angles, intricate flourishes, and a strong vertical emphasis. The ascenders and descenders are elongated, creating a sense of grandeur and formality. However, the font avoids the overly ornate and rigid nature of traditional blackletter, opting for a more streamlined and legible form. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a focus on clarity and readability, even in smaller sizes. This balance between historical authenticity and modern usability makes Cardinal suitable for a range of applications, from elegant branding and packaging to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual presence evokes a sense of tradition and craftsmanship, while its contemporary legibility ensures it remains relevant in modern design contexts.",
