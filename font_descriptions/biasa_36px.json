    "detailed_description": "Biasa is a handwritten script font that captures the casual, expressive nature of everyday writing. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's construction is based on a combination of organic and geometric elements, resulting in a unique balance of fluidity and structure. The ascenders and descenders are well-proportioned, ensuring legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Biasa is friendly and approachable, with a hint of playfulness. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of authenticity and personality, making it suitable for branding, social media, and personal projects. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the tradition of handwritten communication, evoking a sense of intimacy and connection. However, its modern execution and versatility make it equally at home in digital environments, where it can add a touch of warmth and personality to websites, apps, and other digital interfaces.",
