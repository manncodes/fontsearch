    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, features a distinctive double-line structure that creates a bold, almost futuristic aesthetic. The letters are formed by two parallel lines, with subtle variations in their spacing and curvature to define each character. This construction results in a strong, consistent visual identity, with a clear emphasis on the horizontal and vertical axes. The overall effect is one of clean, modern simplicity, reminiscent of early digital interfaces and retro-futuristic design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold, graphic nature lends itself well to headlines, logos, and branding elements, while its clean lines and consistent structure make it adaptable for digital interfaces and user experience design. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, suggesting a connection to the early days of personal computing and the promise of a digital future.",
