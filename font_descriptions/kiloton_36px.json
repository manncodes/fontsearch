    "detailed_description": "Kiloton is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1980s. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with a distinct retro feel. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The bold weight and consistent stroke width contribute to its assertive and confident character. Kiloton's design evokes a sense of energy and dynamism, reminiscent of the technological advancements and futuristic aesthetics of the 1980s. Its sharp angles and bold forms create a sense of power and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its retro aesthetic might not be appropriate for all contexts, particularly those requiring a more refined or contemporary feel.",
