    "detailed_description": "LT Expo is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its flowing curves and uneven strokes create a sense of spontaneity and informality, reminiscent of a quick note scribbled on paper. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and personality, while the overall structure remains consistent and easy to read. LT Expo's casual charm makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as branding for creative businesses, social media graphics, or invitations. Its hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and personal connection, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to communicate warmth and approachability.",
