    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric simplicity, built on a grid-based structure with sharp, angular corners. The thick, consistent stroke weight creates a sense of solidity and strength, while the open counters and generous x-height ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of confident clarity, reminiscent of early digital interfaces and retro gaming aesthetics. The font's bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic vibe adds a touch of playful nostalgia, making it suitable for projects that aim to evoke a sense of playful energy and technological innovation.",
