    "detailed_description": "Kohicle 25 is a playful script font that blends a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a touch of whimsy. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms evoke the feeling of a personal note, while the consistent weight and clear articulation ensure readability. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying stroke widths and the subtle curves that soften the overall impression. The lowercase letters, particularly the 'a' and 'g', exhibit a charmingly rounded form, adding to the font's friendly and approachable character. While the font's informality makes it ideal for casual projects, its legibility and versatility allow it to be used in a range of applications, from social media graphics to branding elements. The font's playful nature evokes a sense of lightheartedness and creativity, making it suitable for projects that aim to convey a sense of fun and personality.",
