    "detailed_description": "Bonoco is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves give it a distinct hand-drawn quality, reminiscent of comic book lettering or vintage signage. The font's construction is characterized by bold strokes and generous curves, creating a sense of dynamism and movement. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on legibility, with open counters and a high x-height ensuring readability even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of friendly approachability, making it suitable for projects that require a lighthearted and engaging tone. Bonoco's bold personality and playful nature make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements that aim to capture attention and convey a sense of fun. Its versatility extends to digital applications, where it can be used for web design, social media graphics, and mobile interfaces, adding a touch of whimsy to digital experiences.",
