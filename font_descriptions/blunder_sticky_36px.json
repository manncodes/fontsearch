Its irregular letterforms and varying stroke weights create a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes.

The font's playful nature evokes a sense of youthful energy and creativity, while its underlying structure ensures readability and professionalism.
