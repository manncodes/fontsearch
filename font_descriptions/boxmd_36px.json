    "detailed_description": "Boxed is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise, rectangular shapes, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The font features a consistent stroke weight throughout, creating a sense of uniformity and balance. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the overall sense of precision and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its readability, especially at smaller sizes. While the overall design is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded corners of some characters, prevent the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanization gives Boxed a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean and modern aesthetic makes it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts where clarity and professionalism are paramount. The font's geometric nature evokes a sense of order and efficiency, while its subtle humanization adds a touch of approachability and warmth. This combination makes Boxed a contemporary typeface that feels both timeless and relevant.",
