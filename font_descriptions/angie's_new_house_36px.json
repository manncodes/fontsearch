    "detailed_description": "Angie's New House is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly condensed, with a wide x-height and open counters that contribute to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the font's angularity and sense of structure. This combination of geometric precision and bold presence creates a font that is both confident and playful, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics and contemporary digital design trends. Its bold weight and condensed form make it ideal for headlines, logos, and short-form text, particularly in digital environments where its retro-futuristic vibe can add a touch of personality and nostalgia. The font's strong visual impact and clear legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and advertising to user interfaces and mobile apps.",
