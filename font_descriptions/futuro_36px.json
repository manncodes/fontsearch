    "detailed_description": "Futura is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner in 1927. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. The letters are characterized by their consistent stroke width, sharp terminals, and open counters, contributing to its high legibility. Futura's bold, confident character is further emphasized by its strong verticality and the absence of any decorative elements. This makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to signage and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and geometric structure evoke a sense of order and efficiency, aligning with the modernist principles of functionality and clarity. Futura's enduring popularity stems from its timeless appeal, its ability to convey both professionalism and modernity, and its adaptability to various contexts.",
