    "detailed_description": "Country Button is a playful and whimsical display font that draws inspiration from vintage craft aesthetics. Each letter is constructed as a patchwork of different textures and patterns, evoking the charm of hand-stitched quilts and embroidered fabrics. The rounded forms and generous curves create a sense of warmth and nostalgia, while the intricate details, including tiny buttons and floral motifs, add a touch of whimsy. The font's bold outlines and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at larger sizes, making it ideal for eye-catching headlines, branding elements, and decorative accents. Its handcrafted aesthetic evokes a sense of handmade charm and rustic charm, making it perfect for projects that celebrate traditional crafts, vintage style, or a touch of playful personality.",
