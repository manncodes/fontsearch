    "detailed_description": "Coconut House is a playful display font that embraces a cartoonish aesthetic while maintaining a degree of legibility. Its rounded forms and exaggerated proportions evoke a sense of fun and whimsy, reminiscent of classic comic book lettering. The font's construction is characterized by bold, chunky strokes with pronounced curves and rounded terminals, creating a visually engaging and approachable style. The generous x-height and open counters ensure readability even at larger sizes, making it suitable for headlines and eye-catching signage. While its playful nature might limit its use in formal contexts, Coconut House excels in applications where a lighthearted and attention-grabbing visual is desired, such as children's books, branding for playful products, or social media graphics. The font's overall character suggests a sense of childlike wonder and a touch of retro nostalgia, evoking memories of classic cartoons and comic strips.",
