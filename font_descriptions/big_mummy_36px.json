    "detailed_description": "Big Mummy is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro feel. Its construction is based on strong, almost square letterforms with minimal curves, giving it a confident and assertive presence. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, however, add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Big Mummy versatile for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong, confident character evokes a sense of mid-century optimism and retro-futurism, making it ideal for projects that want to convey a sense of nostalgia while remaining modern and impactful.",
