    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and sharp, angular terminals, embodies a distinct modern gothic aesthetic. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a strong, consistent structure that feels both precise and powerful. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of confident authority, with a hint of rebellious edge. This font's sharp angles and bold strokes evoke a sense of strength and defiance, reminiscent of early 20th-century gothic designs, but with a contemporary twist. Its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and graphic design projects that require a strong visual impact. However, its angularity might limit its use in extended text blocks, especially at smaller sizes.",
