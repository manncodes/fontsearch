    "detailed_description": "Airbrush 36px is a script font that captures the essence of hand-drawn lettering with a digital twist. Its construction relies on a series of connected strokes, each with a subtle variation in thickness, creating a sense of organic flow. The letterforms are generally rounded, with open counters and a high x-height, contributing to its legibility even at small sizes. The font's personality is playful and approachable, with a hint of vintage charm. It evokes the spirit of hand-painted signage and custom lettering, but with a clean, modern edge. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and website design. Its casual yet refined aesthetic lends itself well to projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of authenticity.",
