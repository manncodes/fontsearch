    "detailed_description": "Foglihten No07 is a contemporary sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is characterized by clean, precise lines and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of clarity and order. The letterforms are generally open and airy, with generous counters and a high x-height that enhances legibility, particularly at smaller sizes. The terminals, while primarily geometric, exhibit a slight rounding that softens the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Foglihten No07 a distinctive personality, making it feel both modern and timeless. Its versatility extends to a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile experiences. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for both large-scale displays and small-scale text, while its subtle warmth and contemporary aesthetic lend it a sense of sophistication and approachability. Foglihten No07 evokes a sense of clarity, confidence, and optimism, reflecting a modern design sensibility that values both functionality and aesthetic appeal.",
