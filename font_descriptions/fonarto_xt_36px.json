    "detailed_description": "Fonarito XT is a bold, playful sans-serif typeface that utilizes a distinctive 3D extrusion effect. The letters are constructed with a geometric foundation, featuring clean, rounded corners and a consistent stroke weight. This geometric base gives the font a sense of order and clarity, while the extruded effect adds a dynamic, almost cartoonish quality. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's playful nature is further emphasized by the slightly exaggerated curves in letters like 'C' and 'S', which add a touch of whimsy to the overall design. Fonarito XT is well-suited for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a bold, attention-grabbing presence is desired. Its playful personality makes it ideal for projects targeting younger audiences or conveying a sense of fun and energy. The font's 3D effect can be particularly effective in digital environments, adding depth and dimension to web designs and mobile applications.",
