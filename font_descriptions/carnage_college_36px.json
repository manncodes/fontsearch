    "detailed_description": "Carnage College is a bold, sans-serif typeface that embodies a raw, rebellious energy. Its chunky letterforms, inspired by classic stencil fonts, are heavily distressed with jagged edges and dripping paint effects, creating a sense of chaotic energy. The font's construction is simple, with geometric shapes and strong, vertical strokes, but the added grunge elements inject a sense of anarchy and rebellion. The high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines and display applications. The font's aggressive personality makes it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of danger or rebellion, such as punk rock posters, street art, or edgy branding. However, its heavy weight and aggressive nature might not be suitable for long blocks of text or delicate designs.",
