    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and sharp angles, exudes a sense of modernism and sophistication. The uppercase letters are particularly striking, with their bold, almost architectural forms. The lowercase letters, while maintaining the geometric aesthetic, are slightly more rounded, adding a touch of approachability. The overall effect is one of confident clarity, with a hint of playful asymmetry in certain letterforms, like the 'A' and 'R'. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its bold, geometric nature lends itself well to headlines, branding, and graphic design projects that require a strong visual presence. The font's clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of progress and dynamism.",
