    "detailed_description": "Fulbo Tano is a bold sans-serif typeface that combines a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, consistent stroke weight and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, even at small sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Fulbo Tano a confident yet approachable personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display purposes, while its legibility and versatility allow it to function well in body text and user interfaces. The font's overall character evokes a sense of modernism and confidence, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and approachable. Its clean lines and bold presence are reminiscent of mid-century design, while its digital-native construction makes it feel contemporary and relevant.",
