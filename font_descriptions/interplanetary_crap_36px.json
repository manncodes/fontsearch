    "detailed_description": "Interplanetary Grand is a display typeface that blends a bold, geometric construction with a distinctly distressed aesthetic. The letters are built with strong, vertical strokes and sharp, angular terminals, creating a sense of solidity and power. The overall structure is highly symmetrical, with consistent proportions and a balanced weight distribution. However, the addition of a textured, worn-out effect, achieved through subtle variations in stroke width and the inclusion of small, irregular details, adds a layer of grit and authenticity. This juxtaposition of clean geometry and rough texture creates a unique visual tension, making the font both striking and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the distressed texture adds a touch of vintage charm. This combination makes it suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to retro-inspired designs and digital interfaces. The font evokes a sense of rugged individualism and a rebellious spirit, reminiscent of vintage signage and industrial design. It suggests a brand that is both confident and authentic, with a strong connection to its roots.",
