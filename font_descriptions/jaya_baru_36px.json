    "detailed_description": "Jaya Baru is a playful display typeface that draws inspiration from classic cartoon lettering, but with a contemporary twist. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves create a sense of fun and energy, while the bold weight and consistent stroke width ensure strong legibility even at large sizes. The font's construction is based on simple geometric shapes, with each letterform carefully crafted to maintain a sense of balance and proportion. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its friendly and approachable character, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold and playful aesthetic is desired. While its origins are rooted in the playful world of cartoons, Jaya Baru's clean lines and modern proportions make it equally suitable for contemporary digital interfaces, adding a touch of whimsy to websites, mobile apps, and social media graphics.",
