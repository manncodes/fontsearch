    "detailed_description": "Frail is a sans-serif typeface that balances a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its clean lines and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and generous ascenders and descenders ensure strong visual presence, even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Frail a distinctive personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for everything from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps, conveying a sense of modernity and sophistication without feeling overly formal or sterile. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of ligatures and stylistic alternates, allowing for creative customization and unique typographic expression.",
