    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a raw, expressive energy, achieved through its gestural construction and intentionally uneven strokes. Each letter appears as if drawn with a single, confident stroke, resulting in a dynamic and slightly chaotic visual. The irregular line weights and sharp angles contribute to a sense of urgency and immediacy, while the overall structure remains legible, ensuring readability even in smaller sizes. The font's inherent roughness evokes a sense of authenticity and rebellion, suggesting a connection to street art, graffiti, and DIY aesthetics. Its bold character makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and projects seeking a raw, edgy, and impactful visual identity.",
