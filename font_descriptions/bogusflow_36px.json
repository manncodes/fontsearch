    "detailed_description": "Bogusflow is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic Western signage and contemporary graphic design trends. Its geometric construction, with sharp corners and strong vertical strokes, creates a sense of ruggedness and authority. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's distinctive features include the exaggerated serifs, which add a touch of whimsy and playfulness, and the slightly rounded terminals, which soften the overall impression. This combination of bold geometry and playful details makes Bogusflow suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and packaging to digital interfaces and editorial design. Its strong visual presence and playful personality make it ideal for projects that require a touch of Western charm and contemporary edge.",
