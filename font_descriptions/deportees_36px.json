    "detailed_description": "Deportees is a bold, expressive typeface that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, almost jagged strokes create a sense of immediacy and urgency, reminiscent of graffiti or street art. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the exaggerated ascenders and descenders add a dynamic visual impact. The overall character is both playful and edgy, suggesting a rebellious spirit and a disregard for traditional typographic conventions. Deportees is well-suited for headlines, posters, and branding projects that require a strong visual presence and a touch of rebelliousness. Its raw energy and unconventional aesthetic make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of authenticity and individuality.",
