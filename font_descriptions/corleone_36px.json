    "detailed_description": "Corleone is a bold, sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, vertical strokes and wide, open counters create a sense of power and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and generous letter spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of boldness and readability makes Corleone suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its strong presence evokes a sense of confidence and sophistication, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. Corleone's design draws inspiration from classic geometric sans-serif fonts like Futura and Avant Garde, but its slightly rounded terminals and more organic curves give it a contemporary edge. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of tradition and modernity.",
