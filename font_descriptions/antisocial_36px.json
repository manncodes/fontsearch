    "detailed_description": "Antisocial (gpx) is a display typeface that embodies a raw, rebellious spirit. Its construction is characterized by bold, irregular strokes with pronounced serifs and a distinct lack of uniformity. The letterforms are often asymmetrical, with uneven weights and exaggerated angles, creating a sense of deliberate imperfection. This intentional roughness contributes to the font's gritty, edgy personality, reminiscent of graffiti or punk rock aesthetics. The high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and short bursts of text. However, its unconventional nature might limit its use in extended body copy. Antisocial (gpx) evokes a sense of rebellion and nonconformity, suggesting a disregard for traditional typographic norms. It resonates with contemporary subcultures that embrace individuality and raw expression, making it a powerful tool for conveying a message of defiance and authenticity.",
