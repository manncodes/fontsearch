    "detailed_description": "Epitough is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a confident and approachable aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, provides a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in letters like 'a' and 'c', soften the geometric rigidity, adding a touch of warmth and approachability. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. Epitough's bold weight and strong presence suggest a sense of authority and confidence, while the rounded details prevent it from feeling overly aggressive. This balance makes it ideal for a range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its contemporary feel, reminiscent of early digital design aesthetics, evokes a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, while its clear and legible forms ensure timeless appeal.",
