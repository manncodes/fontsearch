    "detailed_description": "Gaz is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a bold, geometric aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in a strict grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters enhance readability even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive feature is its use of sharp, almost brutalist terminals, which give it a sense of power and authority. This is further emphasized by the consistent weight and lack of variation in stroke thickness, creating a monolithic and assertive presence. Gaz's design personality is both modern and timeless, drawing inspiration from the geometric sans-serif fonts of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary edge. It evokes a sense of confidence and strength, making it suitable for applications that require a bold and impactful visual statement. Its clear, uncluttered forms make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in situations where a strong visual hierarchy is desired. Gaz's cultural resonance lies in its association with modernism and the digital age, suggesting a sense of innovation and progress. Its bold, geometric forms resonate with the clean lines and minimalist aesthetics prevalent in contemporary design trends.",
