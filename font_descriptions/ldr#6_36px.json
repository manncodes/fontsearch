    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of angularity and geometric precision. Each letterform is constructed from sharp, interlocking angles, creating a sense of dynamic energy and futuristic edge. The consistent use of sharp terminals and a low x-height contributes to the font's aggressive and assertive character. While the overall design is highly stylized, the font maintains a degree of legibility through its clear, open counters and consistent stroke weights. This makes it suitable for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's sharp angles and bold forms evoke a sense of power and authority, suggesting themes of technology, innovation, and the future. It carries a distinct cyberpunk aesthetic, reminiscent of futuristic cityscapes and advanced technology, making it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of cutting-edge design and futuristic vision.",
