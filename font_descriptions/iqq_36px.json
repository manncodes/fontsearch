    "detailed_description": "This font's distinct character stems from its strict geometric construction, where each letterform is built from a series of precisely aligned horizontal and vertical lines. This creates a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early digital typography and the grid-based aesthetics of modern web design. The sharp, unrounded terminals and consistent stroke weights further emphasize this geometric foundation, resulting in a clean and uncluttered appearance. While the overall impression is one of starkness and simplicity, the font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale display and smaller text sizes. This combination of technical precision and visual accessibility makes it a versatile choice for contemporary branding, digital interfaces, and even print applications where a modern and minimalist aesthetic is desired. The font's starkness evokes a sense of efficiency and functionality, suggesting a digital-native design that is both practical and visually striking.",
