    "detailed_description": "Distress is a display typeface that embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic. Its irregular letterforms, inspired by hand-painted signage and distressed textures, create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's bold strokes and exaggerated curves lend a sense of dynamism and movement, while the uneven baseline and inconsistent letter spacing contribute to its rough-hewn charm. This font is ideal for projects that require a bold, attention-grabbing presence, such as posters, headlines, and branding for edgy or rebellious brands. Its distressed character evokes a sense of vintage Americana, reminiscent of hand-painted signs and weathered billboards, adding a layer of nostalgia and authenticity to any design. However, its irregular nature can make it challenging to read in extended text blocks, limiting its use in body copy or lengthy content.",
