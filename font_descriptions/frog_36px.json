    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction and striking multi-layered design, exudes a strong, almost architectural presence. Each letterform is built from a series of parallel lines, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. The sharp, angular terminals and consistent stroke widths contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in letters like 'C' and 'S' add a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements creates a unique character, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from bold headlines to eye-catching branding. The font's strong visual impact and clear legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its contemporary feel aligns well with digital interfaces and modern design trends. The multi-layered construction evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1970s sci-fi aesthetics, yet its clean lines and bold presence feel distinctly modern.",
