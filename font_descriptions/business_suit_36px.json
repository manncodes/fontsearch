    "detailed_description": "Business Suit (3D)px is a bold, playful display font that combines a geometric construction with a distinctly hand-drawn aesthetic. The letters are built with strong, angular shapes, creating a sense of confident structure. However, the edges are softened with subtle curves and irregularities, adding a touch of whimsy and personality. This combination of geometric precision and hand-drawn charm gives the font a unique character, making it feel both modern and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other display applications. The font's playful nature makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality and energy, while its geometric foundation ensures a sense of professionalism and stability. The overall effect is a font that feels both fun and sophisticated, capable of adding a unique visual flair to a wide range of projects.",
