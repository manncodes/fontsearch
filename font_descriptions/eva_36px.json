    "detailed_description": "Eva is a geometric sans-serif typeface built on a grid-based construction, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. Its rounded corners and slightly condensed proportions give it a friendly, approachable feel, while the consistent stroke weight and open counters ensure strong legibility. The font's distinctive feature is its use of double-stroke elements, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'e', which adds a subtle layer of visual interest and a hint of retrofuturism. This combination of geometric precision and rounded details makes Eva suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. Its clean lines and bold presence evoke a sense of confidence and innovation, making it a strong choice for projects that require a modern, yet approachable feel. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the design trends of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly the rise of digital technology and the emergence of a new visual language for the digital age.",
