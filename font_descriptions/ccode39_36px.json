    "detailed_description": "This font is a stark and minimalist design, built entirely from vertical lines of uniform thickness. The absence of curves or serifs creates a stark, almost brutalist aesthetic. The characters are tightly spaced, further emphasizing the geometric nature of the design. While the lack of visual variation might seem limiting, it allows for exceptional legibility, particularly at small sizes. The font's starkness evokes a sense of industrial strength and functionality, reminiscent of early digital interfaces or architectural blueprints. This makes it suitable for projects that require a strong, uncluttered visual identity, such as technical documentation, signage, or minimalist branding.",
