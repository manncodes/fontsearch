    "detailed_description": "Armfight (36px) is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its hand-drawn aesthetic is evident in the uneven strokes, rounded terminals, and exaggerated letterforms. The font's construction is loose and organic, with varying weights and widths adding to its informal character. While the overall design is whimsical, the font maintains a degree of legibility through its clear counters and consistent baseline. Armfight's bold, expressive nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and playful branding projects, particularly in digital contexts where its hand-drawn quality can add a personal touch. The font's cultural associations lean towards contemporary internet culture, evoking the playful spirit of memes and online communities.",
