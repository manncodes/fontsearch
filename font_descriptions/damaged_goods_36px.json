    "detailed_description": "Damaged Goods is a bold sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, vertical strokes and open counters create a sense of clarity and legibility, while the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing contribute to its readability, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both modern and timeless, with a confident yet approachable personality. Its bold weight and distinct character make it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications, while its legibility ensures it can be used effectively for body text as well. The font's bold, confident aesthetic evokes a sense of strength and reliability, while its subtle humanist touches suggest a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it ideal for brands that want to project a sense of authority and trustworthiness without feeling overly formal or cold.",
