    "detailed_description": "Lft is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a delicate balance between geometric precision and subtle humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a clear, almost architectural framework, evident in the straight lines and consistent stroke weights. However, the rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on lowercase letters introduce a touch of softness, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This interplay between geometric structure and humanist detail creates a sense of both clarity and approachability, making Lft suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while its moderate weight and neutral character make it adaptable to both print and digital media. Lft's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modern elegance, reminiscent of mid-century design but with a contemporary edge. It suggests a balance between tradition and innovation, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of sophistication without sacrificing accessibility.",
