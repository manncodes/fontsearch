    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct 3D effect. Each letter is constructed from a series of overlapping circles and lines, creating a sense of depth and dimension. The font's thick strokes and sharp corners give it a strong, industrial feel, while the circular elements add a touch of playfulness. The overall effect is one of both power and sophistication.",
