    "detailed_description": "Besad PX is a bold and geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are built with a distinct three-dimensional effect, achieved through a series of parallel lines that create a sense of depth and solidity. This effect is further enhanced by the use of contrasting weights, with the outer lines being thicker than the inner ones. The overall impression is one of strength and stability, with a touch of retro-futuristic flair. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. Its bold character makes it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of science fiction films and video games from the 1980s. It can be used to create a sense of nostalgia or to add a futuristic edge to contemporary designs.",
