    "detailed_description": "Grand Cru exhibits a classic, yet subtly modern, sans-serif aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, evident in the clean, unornamented strokes and consistent letterforms. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that contribute to its legibility. While the font maintains a sense of formality, the slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in characters like 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Grand Cru a timeless elegance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for both print and digital media, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and signage. The font's versatility allows it to convey a sense of sophistication and professionalism without feeling overly rigid or cold, making it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of clarity and personality.",
