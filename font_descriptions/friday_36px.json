    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a striking simplicity, built upon a geometric foundation with a touch of humanist warmth. The letterforms are constructed with clean, precise lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a sense of modernity and efficiency. However, the subtle curves at the top and bottom of the 'A' introduce a hint of softness, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes the font versatile, suitable for both digital interfaces and print applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and even body text in smaller sizes. The font's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness.",
