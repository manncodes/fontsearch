    "detailed_description": "Cuomotype is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and playful irregularity. Its construction is rooted in a grid-based system, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the sharp, angular terminals. However, the font deviates from strict geometric purity with subtle variations in stroke thickness and the introduction of rounded corners in certain characters, such as the 'a' and 'o'. This interplay between order and irregularity creates a unique visual tension, lending the font a sense of both modernity and approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. Cuomotype's bold, confident character suggests a sense of energy and dynamism, making it ideal for projects that require a contemporary and impactful visual presence. Its playful nature, however, prevents it from feeling overly serious or corporate, allowing it to be used in a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps.",
