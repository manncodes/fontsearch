    "detailed_description": "F25 Bank Printer is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a strong, almost architectural grid, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the precise angles of terminals. This geometric foundation lends a sense of order and clarity, making the font highly legible even at small sizes. However, the typeface avoids feeling overly rigid through subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'c'. This balance between geometric structure and humanist touch creates a typeface that is both modern and approachable, suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold weight and strong contrast make it ideal for headlines and display purposes, while its clear legibility ensures readability even in smaller sizes, making it suitable for body text as well. The font's overall character evokes a sense of reliability and trustworthiness, reminiscent of classic signage and branding from the mid-20th century, yet its clean lines and contemporary proportions make it feel fresh and relevant for modern design projects.",
