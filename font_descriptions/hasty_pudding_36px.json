    "detailed_description": "Hasty Pudding is a playful display font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its rounded forms and irregular strokes create a sense of spontaneity and whimsy, reminiscent of childhood scribbles. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall construction is informal, the careful balancing of curves and angles gives it a sense of structure and control. This balance makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from playful headlines and logos to informal branding and social media graphics. The font's inherent energy and approachability make it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and charm, evoking a sense of fun and lightheartedness.",
