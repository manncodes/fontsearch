    "detailed_description": "Beach Rocks is a display font that embodies a playful, retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a bold, geometric framework, with each letterform built from a series of rounded rectangles and circles. This creates a strong, almost mechanical feel, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics or futuristic sci-fi designs. The font's distinctive feature is the inclusion of small, circular 'rivets' at the corners of each letter, adding a touch of whimsy and a sense of playful detail. These rivets, along with the slightly rounded corners of the letterforms, soften the otherwise rigid geometric structure, creating a balance between playful and professional. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. Its bold, playful character makes it ideal for projects that require a sense of fun and energy, while its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and a connection to a bygone era of technological optimism.
