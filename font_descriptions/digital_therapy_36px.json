    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, presents a bold and modern aesthetic. Its sharp angles and clean lines create a sense of precision and clarity, reminiscent of architectural drawings or digital interfaces. The consistent stroke weight and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. While the overall impression is one of starkness and simplicity, subtle variations in letterforms, such as the slightly rounded terminals of 'a' and 'o', inject a touch of humanity, preventing the design from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes the font versatile, suitable for both digital displays and print applications, particularly in branding, headlines, and graphic design projects that require a strong visual impact and a sense of contemporary edge.",
