    "detailed_description": "Cratense (36px) is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters and minimal serifs enhance its clean, modern feel. The font's bold weight and uniform stroke width create a sense of confidence and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, preventing it from feeling overly rigid. Cratense's design evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and pixel art, yet it remains contemporary and versatile. Its bold, geometric nature makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a strong visual impact and a sense of technological innovation are desired.",
