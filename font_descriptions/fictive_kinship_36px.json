    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, blocky forms and pronounced 3D extrusion, evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s video game graphics and science fiction imagery. The geometric construction of the letters, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of solidity and power. The exaggerated depth of the extrusion adds a playful dimension, suggesting movement and dynamism. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. Its bold character and playful energy make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of nostalgia. The font's retro aesthetic, however, might limit its use in more formal or minimalist contexts.",
