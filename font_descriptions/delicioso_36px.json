    "detailed_description": "This font, with its clean lines and consistent stroke weights, embodies a classic sans-serif aesthetic. The geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and circular forms, particularly in characters like 'O' and 'Q'. The x-height is moderate, contributing to a balanced appearance, while the open counters enhance legibility, especially at smaller sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric structure. This subtle humanization prevents the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. The overall impression is one of clarity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces to printed materials. Its timeless design evokes a sense of professionalism and reliability, while its contemporary feel ensures relevance in modern digital contexts. The font's versatility allows it to seamlessly integrate into both traditional and digital environments, making it a reliable choice for projects requiring a clean, modern aesthetic.",
