    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms, is a striking example of a futuristic design aesthetic. Each letter is constructed from sharp angles and flat planes, creating a sense of solidity and strength. The consistent use of negative space within the letterforms, particularly in characters like 'O' and 'A', adds to the overall sense of structure and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. This makes it suitable for both display and body text applications, particularly in digital environments where bold, clear communication is essential. The font's angularity and sharp edges evoke a sense of speed and dynamism, suggesting a connection to technology and innovation. It carries a distinct cyberpunk vibe, reminiscent of futuristic cityscapes and advanced technology, making it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of cutting-edge design and forward-thinking concepts.",
