    "detailed_description": "Alterner is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. The letterforms are characterized by sharp corners, open counters, and a high x-height, contributing to its strong legibility. The terminals, while generally sharp, exhibit a slight rounding, adding a touch of approachability and preventing a stark, overly rigid feel. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Alterner a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly cold or corporate. Alterner's design evokes a sense of modernism and functionality, reflecting the clean lines and minimalist aesthetics of contemporary design. It suggests a sense of clarity, efficiency, and accessibility, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a straightforward and contemporary visual language.",
