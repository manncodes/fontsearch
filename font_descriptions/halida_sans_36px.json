    "detailed_description": "Halida Sans is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights, giving the font a sense of order and clarity. However, the rounded terminals and slightly curved ascenders and descenders add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth is evident in the overall character of the font, which is both confident and friendly. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. The font's contemporary aesthetic and versatility make it a strong choice for projects that require a clean, modern look with a touch of personality. Its cultural associations evoke a sense of optimism and progress, reminiscent of mid-century modern design, while its digital-native qualities make it ideal for contemporary web and mobile applications.",
