    "detailed_description": "Cogtan is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its geometric construction, characterized by sharp angles and clean lines, evokes a sense of precision and order. The font's unique feature is its bold, extruded outline, which adds a three-dimensional quality and a sense of depth. This outline, while visually striking, also contributes to the font's legibility, ensuring clarity even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Cogtan is confident and assertive, with a hint of playfulness. It draws inspiration from the graphic design trends of the 1980s, particularly the use of bold geometric forms and futuristic imagery. This makes it particularly relevant for contemporary projects that seek to evoke a sense of nostalgia for that era, while still maintaining a modern edge. Cogtan's bold outline and geometric construction make it well-suited for headlines, logos, and other display applications. Its strong legibility also makes it suitable for use in digital interfaces, particularly for mobile devices where screen space is limited. However, its bold nature might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
