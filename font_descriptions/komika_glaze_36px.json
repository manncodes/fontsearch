    "detailed_description": "Komika Glaze is a playful display font that draws inspiration from classic cartoon lettering, but with a contemporary digital edge. Its rounded, exaggerated forms are built with a distinct 3D effect, achieved through a thick outline that creates a sense of depth and dimension. The exaggerated curves and playful proportions give the font a sense of energy and movement, while the clean, consistent linework ensures readability even at smaller sizes. This combination of retro charm and modern execution makes Komika Glaze ideal for projects that require a fun, approachable, and slightly irreverent tone. Its bold personality makes it perfect for headlines, logos, and branding elements, especially in digital contexts where its playful energy can be fully realized.",
