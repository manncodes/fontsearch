    "detailed_description": "Brand New Day (Midnight) is a playful and energetic display font that draws inspiration from hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, almost wobbly construction gives it a distinct personality, reminiscent of a child's scribbles or a quick note jotted down in a hurry. The font's bold strokes and exaggerated curves create a sense of movement and dynamism, while the uneven spacing and inconsistent letterforms add to its whimsical charm. Despite its casual appearance, the font remains legible due to its clear, open counters and well-defined letterforms. Its versatility allows it to be used for a variety of purposes, from eye-catching headlines and logos to playful packaging and social media graphics. The font's inherent energy and youthful spirit make it a perfect choice for projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality.",
