    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and clean lines, exudes a sense of clarity and order. The consistent stroke weights and sharp terminals contribute to its crisp, modern aesthetic. The lowercase letters, particularly the 'a' and 'g', exhibit a subtle humanist touch, adding a hint of warmth to the overall impression. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its neutral character and lack of overt stylistic flourishes make it adaptable to a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to user interfaces. The font's clean, uncluttered design evokes a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while its subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly sterile. It suggests a contemporary approach to design, balancing functionality with a touch of elegance.",
