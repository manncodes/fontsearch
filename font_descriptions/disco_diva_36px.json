    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, features a bold, graphic style reminiscent of 1970s design. Each letterform is composed of multiple parallel lines, creating a sense of depth and movement. The consistent stroke width and sharp terminals contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character is confident and energetic, with a playful edge. The font's bold lines and geometric forms evoke a sense of retro futurism, reminiscent of disco balls and neon lights. It's well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of nostalgia. While its bold nature might limit its use in large blocks of text, it excels in short bursts, adding a vibrant and memorable touch to any design.",
