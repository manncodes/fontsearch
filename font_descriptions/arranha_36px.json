    "detailed_description": "Arranha is a bold, expressive script font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, gestural strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying thicknesses of strokes, the playful angles, and the occasional flourishes. While the overall impression is one of casual informality, the font's clear legibility and consistent baseline ensure readability even in smaller sizes. Arranha's unique character makes it ideal for adding a touch of personality to branding, packaging, or digital content, particularly in contexts where a sense of authenticity and creative expression is desired.",
