    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters constructed from precise, almost mechanical lines and curves. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at small sizes. The overall proportions are balanced and harmonious, creating a sense of order and clarity. While the geometric construction lends a sense of formality, the subtle curves in the lowercase letters, particularly in the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes the font versatile, suitable for both technical applications and more creative projects. The font's clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, making it ideal for branding, web design, and user interfaces. Its contemporary feel aligns well with modern design trends, suggesting a forward-thinking and innovative approach.",
