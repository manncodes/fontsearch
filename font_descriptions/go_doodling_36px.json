    "detailed_description": "Go Dodling is a playful script font that blends a casual, hand-drawn aesthetic with a touch of vintage charm. The letterforms are characterized by their rounded, organic shapes and irregular, expressive strokes. The ascenders and descenders are elongated, adding to the font's whimsical feel. The overall construction is loose and informal, with a slight slant that contributes to its dynamic energy. This font evokes a sense of warmth and nostalgia, reminiscent of handwritten notes or vintage signage. Its informal character makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as children's books, invitations, or social media graphics. However, its legibility can be compromised at smaller sizes, making it less suitable for extended text blocks or formal documents.",
