    "detailed_description": "Carogna is a display typeface that blends classic serif construction with a playful, almost cartoonish personality. Its rounded terminals and exaggerated curves give it a distinct charm, while its sturdy strokes and consistent weight maintain a sense of readability. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines and branding elements. The overall effect is a font that feels both familiar and slightly whimsical, evoking a sense of nostalgia while remaining fresh and contemporary. Its playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality, while its strong structure ensures it can hold its own in more formal settings.",
