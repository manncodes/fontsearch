    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Could Be Bloody\", embodies a raw, expressive energy. Its calligraphic origins are evident in the fluid strokes and dynamic letterforms, with each character exhibiting a unique, almost spontaneous, personality. The unevenness of the line weight and the occasional flourishes add to the sense of immediacy and authenticity. While the overall style leans towards a casual, handwritten aesthetic, the font maintains a degree of legibility, making it suitable for short bursts of text or headlines. The font's inherent informality and expressive nature make it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of authenticity, such as branding for independent businesses, creative projects, or social media graphics. It evokes a sense of rebellion and individuality, reminiscent of punk rock aesthetics and DIY culture, while also possessing a playful charm that makes it approachable and engaging.",
