    "detailed_description": "Highway Gothic is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a classic, geometric aesthetic with a touch of modern edge. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, with clean, precise lines and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are highly legible, featuring a high x-height and open counters that ensure readability even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a subtle touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Highway Gothic a confident yet approachable personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and signage, while its versatility allows it to be used effectively in both print and digital media. The font's historical roots in the mid-20th century, combined with its contemporary relevance, make it a timeless choice for projects that require a balance of tradition and modernity.",
