    "detailed_description": "Cold War 36PX is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on strong, rectilinear forms with sharp corners and minimal curves. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, contributing to its excellent legibility even at small sizes. The weight is heavy, with a consistent stroke width throughout, creating a sense of solidity and impact. The overall character is assertive and confident, with a hint of industrial grit. The font's design evokes the starkness and functionality of Cold War-era architecture and design, with a touch of Soviet-era graphic design influence. Its bold, no-nonsense style makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications where a strong visual presence is desired. However, its lack of stylistic variations and limited character set might limit its use in extended text settings.",
