    "detailed_description": "Angle (36pt) by Omegaville Techno Square is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letterforms are characterized by sharp corners, strong vertical strokes, and a consistent width, creating a sense of solidity and power. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and geometric structure lend it a sense of authority and confidence, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions add a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Angle (36pt) a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to digital interfaces.",
