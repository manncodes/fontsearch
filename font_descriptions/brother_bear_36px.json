    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and precise curves of its letterforms. The overall structure is clean and uncluttered, with a consistent stroke weight that contributes to its modern aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The lowercase 'a' and 'g' are particularly interesting, featuring open counters that add a touch of playfulness to the otherwise strict geometric forms. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanist details creates a font that feels both contemporary and approachable. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's overall character evokes a sense of clarity and efficiency, suggesting a brand or message that is both modern and reliable.",
