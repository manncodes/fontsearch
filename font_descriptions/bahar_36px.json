    "detailed_description": "Bahar is a display typeface that combines a classic slab serif structure with a playful, almost cartoonish, double-outline treatment. The geometric construction of the letterforms, with their strong vertical strokes and consistent proportions, creates a sense of solidity and stability. However, the double outline, which is slightly offset and features a subtle inner shadow, adds a touch of whimsy and dimension. This combination of classic structure and playful detail gives Bahar a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and logos to playful illustrations and branding. The font's bold and confident character, reminiscent of vintage signage and comic book lettering, evokes a sense of nostalgia and fun. Its strong visual presence and playful nature make it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a strong visual impact.",
