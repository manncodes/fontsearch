    "detailed_description": "C7nazara (36px) is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its clean lines, open counters, and consistent stroke weights. The font's construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly legible and balanced appearance. The rounded terminals and slightly curved letterforms, particularly in lowercase letters, add a touch of approachability and warmth to the otherwise geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives C7nazara a modern yet timeless feel, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its strong legibility and clean aesthetic make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, while its versatility allows it to adapt to both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. The font's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, confidence, and modernity, suggesting a brand or project that is both innovative and reliable.",
