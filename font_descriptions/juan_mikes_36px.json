    "detailed_description": "Juan Mikes is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are constructed with clean, precise lines and open counters, creating a sense of clarity and legibility. The slightly rounded terminals, however, add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail gives Juan Mikes a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its approachable nature makes it suitable for body text as well. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modernism and optimism, suggesting a forward-thinking and confident brand. Its clean lines and simple forms also make it feel timeless, suggesting a sense of stability and reliability.",
