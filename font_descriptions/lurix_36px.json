    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters constructed from clean, precise lines and sharp angles. The consistent stroke weight and uniform letterforms create a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially at smaller sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance readability. While the overall aesthetic is undeniably modern, the font avoids feeling overly sterile or cold. Subtle variations in the letterforms, such as the slightly rounded terminals on lowercase letters, introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes the font versatile for a range of applications, from clean interfaces to bold headlines. Its contemporary feel evokes a sense of efficiency and innovation, making it suitable for projects that require a modern and confident voice.",
