    "detailed_description": "The font's construction is based on a bold, geometric structure, with each letterform built from a series of sharp, angular strokes. This creates a strong, assertive presence, reminiscent of early digital typography or even the pixelated graphics of retro video games. The overall effect is one of confident, almost aggressive energy, yet the font retains a degree of playfulness through its slightly distorted letterforms and the inclusion of unique glyphs like the stylized exclamation point and question mark. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. However, its bold, angular nature might make it less appropriate for extended reading in print, while its digital origins make it particularly well-suited for web design, branding, and other digital media. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of retrofuturism, blending the sharp edges of early digital design with a playful, almost rebellious spirit, suggesting a sense of innovation and disruption.",
