    "detailed_description": "Heyro Fun is a display typeface that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its construction is based on a gestural, almost calligraphic approach, with each letterform appearing as a single, fluid stroke. This results in a highly irregular and dynamic appearance, with varying stroke widths and uneven letter heights. The font's personality is bold and playful, conveying a sense of spontaneity and youthful energy. It's ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's rough edges and unevenness create a sense of immediacy and authenticity, making it perfect for projects that aim to communicate a sense of informality or rebellion. However, its legibility can be challenging at smaller sizes, and its unconventional nature may not be suitable for all contexts.",
