    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a distinct geometric aesthetic, built upon a grid-based structure with sharp, angular terminals. The consistent stroke weight and uniform letterforms create a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early digital typography. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. While the overall impression is one of starkness and precision, the subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle warmth makes it adaptable for a range of applications, from tech interfaces and branding to editorial design and even playful graphic elements. The font's inherent digital heritage evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, while its clean lines and strong presence suggest a confident and assertive personality.",
