    "detailed_description": "FM University is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are built with a double-stroke outline, creating a sense of depth and solidity. This outline is not perfectly symmetrical, with the inner stroke slightly offset from the outer stroke, adding a subtle visual interest. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its strong legibility, while the open counters enhance its readability even at smaller sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of playfulness. It evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics and early video game graphics. This makes it particularly well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold, retro-inspired aesthetic is desired. However, its strong geometric structure and consistent proportions also make it suitable for more formal applications, such as signage or editorial design, where a clear and legible typeface is needed. The font's bold personality and retro-futuristic vibe make it a versatile choice for projects that seek to capture a sense of nostalgia while remaining modern and impactful.",
