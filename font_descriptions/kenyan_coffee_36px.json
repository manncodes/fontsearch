    "detailed_description": "Kenyan Coffee is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built upon a strong, consistent grid, with clean lines and sharp corners, giving it a sense of clarity and precision. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric structure and humanist details creates a font that is both legible and visually engaging. The high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at small sizes, making it suitable for digital interfaces and branding applications. The font's bold weight and confident slant convey a sense of energy and dynamism, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Kenyan Coffee's contemporary aesthetic and its ability to convey both professionalism and approachability make it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to digital interfaces.",
