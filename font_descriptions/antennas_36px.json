    "detailed_description": "Antennas 36px is a bold, decorative display typeface that draws inspiration from both vintage signage and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its defining feature is the intricate, multi-layered construction of each letterform, achieved through a series of parallel lines that create a sense of depth and texture. This intricate detail, reminiscent of retro neon signs or pixelated graphics, gives the font a unique visual appeal. The overall proportions are robust, with a high x-height and generous counters, ensuring strong legibility even at large sizes. The sharp terminals and angular forms contribute to a sense of confidence and energy, while the subtle variations in line weight add a touch of dynamism. Antennas 36px is ideally suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era while simultaneously feeling fresh and contemporary, making it a versatile choice for projects that seek to blend classic and modern sensibilities.",
