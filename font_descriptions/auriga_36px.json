    "detailed_description": "This font is a striking example of geometric sans-serif design, built entirely from angled lines and sharp corners. Each letterform is constructed with precision, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic. The consistent use of diagonal strokes creates a dynamic energy, while the open counters and high x-height ensure excellent legibility even at small sizes. The font's bold, assertive character is further emphasized by the absence of any curves or rounded terminals, lending it a sense of futuristic minimalism. This makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's angularity evokes a sense of speed and technology, suggesting a connection to the digital age and the world of innovation. However, its clean lines and balanced proportions also lend it a sense of order and control, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of sophistication.",
