The glyphs are primarily composed of bold, black-and-white illustrations, showcasing a range of medieval imagery, from knights and shields to crowns and heraldic beasts. The intricate details, like the feathered wings of a griffin or the intricate patterns on a shield, are rendered with a level of precision that speaks to the font's historical inspiration. The overall aesthetic is one of grandeur and authority, reminiscent of medieval manuscripts and illuminated texts. While the font's primary function is decorative, its bold and clear forms make it suitable for titles, headings, and branding elements that require a strong visual impact. The font's historical context lends itself to projects that seek to evoke a sense of heritage, nobility, or even a touch of fantasy.",
