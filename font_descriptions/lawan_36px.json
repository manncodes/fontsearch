    "detailed_description": "Lawan is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by sharp angles, heavy strokes, and a lack of traditional serifs, creating a strong, assertive presence. The letterforms are designed with a focus on clarity and impact, with wide open counters and a high x-height ensuring legibility even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of raw power and unyielding confidence, reminiscent of industrial design and urban architecture. This makes Lawan particularly effective for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual statement is desired. However, its bold nature and lack of subtlety might limit its use in longer blocks of text or more delicate design contexts. Despite its starkness, Lawan possesses a certain playful energy, with the jagged edges and unexpected angles adding a touch of irreverence. This unexpected combination of strength and playfulness makes it suitable for projects that require a bold statement with a hint of personality.",
