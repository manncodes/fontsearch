    "detailed_description": "Leo Arrow is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Leo Arrow a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. The font's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. This combination makes it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of authority and approachability, such as corporate branding, technology websites, or educational materials.",
