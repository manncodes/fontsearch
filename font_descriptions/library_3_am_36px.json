    "detailed_description": "Library 3 AM is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, double-lined construction. The geometric forms are clean and precise, with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight throughout. This creates a strong visual impact, conveying a sense of clarity and order. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, with a touch of retro influence reminiscent of 1980s digital design. This makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold and impactful statement is desired. The font's clean lines and geometric structure also lend themselves well to minimalist design aesthetics, while its retro undertones add a layer of playful nostalgia.",
