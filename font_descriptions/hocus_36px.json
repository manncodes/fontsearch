    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters built from precise, almost architectural lines. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring good legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall structure is balanced and symmetrical, creating a sense of order and clarity. While the geometric construction lends a sense of formality, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. The font's clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a contemporary aesthetic with a touch of approachability.",
