    "detailed_description": "Libercity is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of humanist warmth. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, lines and angles, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are characterized by their open counters, which contribute to excellent legibility, especially at smaller sizes. The terminals, while primarily geometric, exhibit a slight rounding that softens the overall impression, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This subtle balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Libercity a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for branding, editorial design, web interfaces, and even signage, where its strong legibility and clean lines ensure readability even at large sizes. The font's overall character evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, suggesting a forward-thinking approach to design. Its clean lines and geometric construction align with contemporary trends in digital design, while the subtle humanist details add a touch of approachability and warmth, making it suitable for projects that require a balance between professionalism and accessibility.",
