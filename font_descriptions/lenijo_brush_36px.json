    "detailed_description": "Lenijo Brush is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on clean, rectangular shapes, with sharp corners and minimal curves. The letterforms are tightly spaced, creating a dense and compact visual impact. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of retro-futuristic charm. It evokes a sense of digital technology and early computer graphics, reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that require a bold, modern, and slightly nostalgic feel. Its technical limitations lie in its limited character set and lack of stylistic alternates, but its strong visual presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where impact is paramount.",
