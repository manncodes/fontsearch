    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and rounded terminals, embodies a playful yet professional aesthetic. The consistent stroke weight and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The rounded corners soften the geometric structure, lending a sense of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and organic curves evokes a sense of modernism with a touch of retro charm, reminiscent of 1960s design trends. Its versatility makes it ideal for branding, web design, and editorial applications, particularly where a clean, contemporary feel is desired.",
