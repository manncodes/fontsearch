    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, angular strokes and dramatic slant, evokes a sense of power and dynamism. The sharp, geometric construction of the letterforms, particularly evident in the uppercase characters, creates a sense of precision and authority. The exaggerated slant, while adding a touch of playfulness, also contributes to the overall sense of movement and energy. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's bold character and dramatic slant make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. It can also be used effectively for editorial design, particularly for articles with a strong narrative or a sense of urgency. However, its bold and angular nature may not be suitable for all applications, particularly those requiring a more subtle or delicate aesthetic.",
