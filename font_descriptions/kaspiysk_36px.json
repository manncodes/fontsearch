    "detailed_description": "Kaspiysk 382 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are designed with a strong emphasis on horizontals, creating a sense of stability and solidity. The bold weight and thick strokes contribute to a commanding presence, while the subtle beveling adds a touch of dimensionality and visual interest. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, evoking a sense of power and authority. It draws inspiration from mid-century modern design, particularly the use of geometric forms and bold lines. However, the font's clean execution and contemporary proportions make it relevant for modern applications. Kaspiysk 382 is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its bold weight and geometric construction make it effective for large-scale displays, while its clean lines and consistent proportions ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic adds a touch of nostalgia and intrigue, making it suitable for projects that aim to evoke a sense of innovation and progress.",
