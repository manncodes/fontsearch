    "detailed_description": "Cosmas is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The letters are characterized by sharp corners, strong vertical strokes, and a consistent x-height, creating a sense of order and stability. However, the font's distinctive feature is its subtle distortion, adding a touch of playful energy to the otherwise rigid structure. This distortion is achieved through slight variations in the letterforms, creating a sense of movement and dynamism. The overall effect is a font that is both modern and approachable, with a strong visual presence that can be used for a variety of applications. Cosmas is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, where its bold character and clear legibility make it stand out. Its playful distortion adds a touch of personality, making it suitable for projects that require a balance of professionalism and energy.",
