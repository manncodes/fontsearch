    "detailed_description": "Geo Sans Light exhibits a clean, modern aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and open counters, contributing to its high legibility. The overall structure is balanced and uncluttered, with a slight humanist touch evident in the subtle curves of the terminals. This combination of geometric precision and subtle warmth creates a font that feels both professional and approachable. The light weight adds a sense of airiness and lightness, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to branding materials. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of clarity and efficiency, aligning with the values of modern digital culture.",
