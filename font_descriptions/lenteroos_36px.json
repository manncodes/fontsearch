    "detailed_description": "Lenteroos is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a bold, geometric aesthetic with a touch of humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a strict grid system, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the precise alignment of terminals. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. While the overall impression is one of confident clarity, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in letters like 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Lenteroos a versatile personality, suitable for a range of applications from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its strong presence and clear readability make it ideal for conveying authority and confidence, while its subtle warmth ensures a welcoming and approachable feel. Lenteroos evokes a sense of modernism, drawing inspiration from the geometric sans-serif designs of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary edge that feels both timeless and relevant.",
