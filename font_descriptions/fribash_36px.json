    "detailed_description": "Fribash is a playful yet legible sans-serif typeface that blends a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a touch of geometric precision. Its rounded letterforms and slightly irregular stroke widths create a sense of informality and approachability, while the consistent baseline and well-defined counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is friendly and approachable, reminiscent of handwritten notes or informal signage. It draws inspiration from mid-century graphic design, particularly the use of bold, expressive typography in advertising and branding. Fribash's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of authenticity and personality, making it suitable for projects that require a human touch. Its versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of applications, from website headers and social media graphics to packaging and merchandise. However, its casual nature might not be appropriate for formal documents or high-end branding.",
