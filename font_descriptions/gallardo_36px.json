    "detailed_description": "Gallardo is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost brutalist aesthetic. Its construction is based on simple, rectilinear shapes, with sharp corners and minimal curves. The letterforms are tightly packed, with a low x-height and a consistent stroke weight throughout. This creates a sense of density and solidity, while the sharp angles and bold forms convey a sense of power and authority. The font's overall character is assertive and confident, with a hint of retrofuturism. It evokes the bold graphic design of the 1980s and 1990s, with its strong geometric forms and bold, almost aggressive presence. However, its clean lines and simple construction also give it a contemporary feel, making it suitable for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's bold, assertive nature makes it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility at larger sizes makes it suitable for display purposes. However, its low x-height and tight letter spacing may make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
