    "detailed_description": "Elektra is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanism is further emphasized by the font's high x-height and open counters, which contribute to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. Elektra's versatility is evident in its ability to seamlessly transition from bold headlines to body text, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its retro-inspired aesthetic, reminiscent of 1980s digital design, adds a touch of nostalgia and personality, while its clean lines and contemporary feel ensure its relevance in today's digital landscape.",
