    "detailed_description": "Campanile is a serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a playful retro charm. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif anatomy, with strong vertical strokes, delicate serifs, and a moderate x-height. However, the font's personality is injected through subtle details like the rounded terminals, the playful curves of the lowercase 'g' and 'j', and the distinctive swashes on the uppercase 'Q' and 'R'. These elements create a visual balance between formality and whimsy, making Campanile suitable for a range of applications from branding and editorial design to packaging and digital interfaces. The font's retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era, while its clean lines and strong legibility ensure it remains relevant in contemporary design. Campanile's playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and charm, while its classic foundation ensures it remains sophisticated and timeless.",
