    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, built upon a grid of squares and rectangles. Each letterform is a precise arrangement of these shapes, creating a sense of order and clarity. The consistent stroke weight and sharp corners contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic, while the subtle beveling adds a touch of dimensionality. This dimensionality, achieved through a slight offset of the outer stroke, gives the font a sense of depth and dynamism, hinting at a three-dimensional form. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro-futuristic flair. This font is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of power and authority, while the subtle beveling adds a touch of playfulness and intrigue. The font's clean lines and sharp corners suggest a sense of precision and control, while the overall structure hints at a futuristic, technological aesthetic. This font is a powerful tool for conveying a sense of modernity, innovation, and confidence.",
