    "detailed_description": "Azertype is a bold and geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies the spirit of early digital design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the font's clean and modern aesthetic. While the overall impression is one of starkness and simplicity, subtle variations in letterforms, such as the rounded corners of the lowercase 'a' and 'e', inject a touch of humanity into the design. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic details gives Azertype a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital signage. Its strong visual presence and clear legibility make it ideal for conveying a sense of modernity, technology, and innovation.",
