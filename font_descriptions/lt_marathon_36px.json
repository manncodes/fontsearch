    "detailed_description": "LT Marathon is a contemporary sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is characterized by clean, precise lines and a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of clarity and order. The letterforms are slightly rounded, particularly at the terminals, which softens the overall impression and adds a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives LT Marathon a distinctive personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. The font's clean lines and modern aesthetic also make it well-suited for branding and corporate communications, where a sense of professionalism and sophistication is desired. LT Marathon's subtle curves and rounded terminals evoke a sense of movement and energy, suggesting a forward-thinking and dynamic brand. Its contemporary design language aligns with current trends in digital design, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, modern, and approachable aesthetic.",
