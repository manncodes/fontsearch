    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct double-outline construction, creating a bold and graphic presence. The outlines are consistently parallel, lending a sense of precision and order. The letterforms themselves are geometrically based, with clean, unornamented shapes. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to strong legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, especially at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of confident clarity and modern simplicity. The font's bold character evokes a sense of authority and professionalism, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and geometric structure suggest a sense of order and efficiency, aligning well with contemporary design trends. The double-outline construction adds a layer of visual interest and depth, while maintaining a sense of restraint. This font's versatility allows it to be used effectively in a wide range of applications, from large-scale signage to small-scale web typography.",
