    "detailed_description": "Costura is a font that embodies the spirit of pixel art, crafted with a distinct cross-stitch aesthetic. Each letterform is constructed from a grid of intersecting lines, creating a visually engaging and undeniably retro feel. The consistent use of sharp angles and tight curves gives the font a strong, almost mechanical personality, while the open counters and generous x-height ensure excellent legibility even at small sizes. This combination of technical precision and playful charm makes Costura ideal for projects that require a touch of nostalgia or a playful, digital-native aesthetic. Its bold, pixelated forms evoke a sense of handcrafted charm, reminiscent of early computer graphics and the DIY spirit of the internet's early days. Costura's unique character makes it perfect for branding, web design, and even print projects that seek to capture a sense of playful retro-futurism.",
