    "detailed_description": "Kosaken is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from Art Deco and Bauhaus design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean lines, sharp angles, and a strong sense of order. The letters are composed of simple geometric shapes, such as squares, triangles, and circles, which are combined in a unique and visually striking way. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The bold strokes and sharp terminals give the font a confident and assertive personality, while the subtle curves in some letters, like the 'O' and 'C', add a touch of warmth and approachability. Kosaken's bold and geometric aesthetic makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its clean and modern design also makes it suitable for digital applications, such as websites and mobile interfaces. The font's cultural associations range from the geometric precision of Bauhaus to the bold graphic style of Art Deco, evoking a sense of modernity and sophistication. Its strong visual presence and clear legibility make it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects.",
