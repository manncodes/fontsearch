    "detailed_description": "Whiteboard is a playful, bold sans-serif font that evokes the hand-drawn aesthetic of a marker on a whiteboard. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated 3D effect, achieved through a thick outline and a subtle shadow. This creates a sense of depth and dimension, adding a touch of whimsy to the otherwise simple geometric forms. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its friendly and approachable personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from casual signage to playful branding. While the font's bold nature makes it ideal for headlines and large-scale displays, its legibility remains strong even at smaller sizes, thanks to its generous x-height and clear letterforms. The overall effect is one of casual confidence, suggesting a playful yet professional tone that resonates with contemporary digital culture.",
