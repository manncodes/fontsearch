    "detailed_description": "A Autobus Omnibus is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, rounded forms with a consistent weight distribution, creating a sense of solidity and stability. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to its legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of playfulness in its rounded forms. It evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of 1960s and 1970s design trends. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and signage. Its strong presence and retro appeal make it particularly effective for projects that require a sense of confidence and modernity.",
