    "detailed_description": "Futurism is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, with each letterform built from simple lines and curves. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a sense of dynamism and energy to the overall design. The consistent stroke weight and lack of embellishments create a sense of clarity and efficiency, making it ideal for digital interfaces and contemporary branding. Futurism's bold, confident character evokes a sense of progress and innovation, aligning it with modern technology and forward-thinking design. Its clean lines and geometric structure suggest a sense of order and rationality, while the sharp angles and dynamic forms hint at a sense of speed and movement. This combination of technical precision and visual dynamism makes Futurism a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from website design and mobile apps to corporate branding and editorial layouts.",
