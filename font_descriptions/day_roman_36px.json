    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in the consistent, almost mechanical construction of its letterforms. The strokes are crisp and clean, with sharp terminals and minimal variation in thickness. This creates a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early 20th-century modernist design. However, the font avoids being overly rigid by incorporating subtle humanist details, such as the slight curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', which add a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is a balanced blend of clarity and personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it particularly effective for large-scale displays, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling cold or impersonal. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey both professionalism and approachability, making it a versatile choice for modern design projects.",
