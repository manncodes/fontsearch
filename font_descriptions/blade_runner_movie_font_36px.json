    "detailed_description": "Blade Runner is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies the futuristic aesthetic of its namesake film. Its construction is based on sharp angles and strong, consistent strokes, creating a sense of speed and dynamism. The letters are designed with a distinct slant, adding a sense of motion and energy. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a hint of aggression. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The bold weight and sharp angles make it ideal for headlines and branding, while its futuristic aesthetic makes it perfect for science fiction, cyberpunk, and other genre-related projects. The font's cultural associations are firmly rooted in the 1980s, evoking a sense of retro-futurism and the cyberpunk movement. It's a powerful and memorable typeface that can add a touch of grit and edge to any design.",
