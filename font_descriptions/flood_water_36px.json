    "detailed_description": "Flood Water is a display typeface that combines a bold, geometric structure with a playful, almost whimsical, execution. The letters are built with a strong, almost blocky, construction, featuring sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight. This creates a sense of solidity and stability, reminiscent of early 20th-century geometric sans-serifs. However, the font's distinctive character comes from the unique treatment of its terminals, which are often jagged and uneven, giving the impression of water dripping or flowing. This unexpected detail adds a touch of whimsy and movement to the otherwise rigid structure, creating a dynamic and engaging visual experience. The font's bold weight and strong contrast make it highly legible, even at small sizes, while its playful nature makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from headlines and logos to posters and packaging. The overall effect is a font that is both modern and nostalgic, evoking a sense of playful energy and creative expression.",
