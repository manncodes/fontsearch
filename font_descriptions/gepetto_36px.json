    "detailed_description": "Geppetto is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a surprisingly legible structure. Its rounded, bulbous forms are reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, but the consistent stroke weights and well-defined counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive feature is its exaggerated, almost whimsical, treatment of letterforms like 'a', 'g', and 'o', which adds a sense of personality and charm. While the overall impression is lighthearted and informal, the font's strong structure and clear articulation make it suitable for a range of applications, from playful branding to eye-catching headlines. The font's playful nature evokes a sense of childhood nostalgia, reminiscent of vintage cartoons and comic books, while its contemporary design language makes it feel fresh and relevant for modern digital applications.",
