    "detailed_description": "Liszt-hius-alkimista (3SPX) is a display typeface that embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by bold, geometric forms with sharp, jagged edges, reminiscent of metalwork or architectural structures. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, creating a sense of density and intensity. The overall effect is one of ruggedness and power, with a distinct lack of refinement. The font's personality is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of strength and defiance. It evokes a sense of rebellion and nonconformity, drawing inspiration from punk rock aesthetics and underground subcultures. The font's jagged edges and distressed texture suggest a sense of grit and authenticity, making it suitable for projects that require a raw and edgy feel. Its bold, geometric forms and tight letter spacing make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements that demand attention. However, its lack of refinement and legibility limitations make it less suitable for extended body text. The font's cultural associations are rooted in counterculture movements and underground art scenes, suggesting a rebellious spirit and a rejection of mainstream norms.",
