    "detailed_description": "Larke Sans Light exhibits a clean, modern aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a high x-height, contributing to its strong legibility. The open counters and generous spacing between letters enhance readability, particularly at smaller sizes. While the overall structure is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance creates a font that feels both professional and friendly. Larke Sans Light's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website interfaces and mobile apps to branding materials and editorial design. Its clean lines and contemporary feel resonate with the digital age, while its subtle warmth and legibility ensure its effectiveness across various media and sizes.",
