    "detailed_description": "Arm Wrestler is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a confident, yet approachable aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, provides a sense of order and clarity. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. While the overall structure is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Arm Wrestler a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold weight and confident stance make it ideal for headlines and branding elements, while its legibility and approachability make it suitable for body text and user interfaces. The font's overall character evokes a sense of modernism and functionality, suggesting a connection to digital culture and contemporary design trends. Its clean lines and bold presence make it a strong choice for projects that require a sense of authority and clarity, while its subtle humanist details ensure that it remains approachable and engaging.",
