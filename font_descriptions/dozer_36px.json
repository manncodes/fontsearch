    "detailed_description": "Dozer is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and sharp corners. The letters are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of retro charm. Its bold weight and geometric structure evoke a sense of power and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability. Dozer's design is reminiscent of 1970s and 1980s graphic design, with its bold, geometric forms and strong contrasts. However, its clean lines and modern proportions make it feel equally relevant in contemporary digital contexts. The font is well-suited for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold weight and geometric structure make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. Dozer's assertive personality and retro charm make it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from bold branding to playful digital interfaces.",
