    "detailed_description": "Gallagher is a display typeface that embodies a bold, playful spirit with a retro-inspired aesthetic. Its defining characteristic is the exaggerated 3D extrusion, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. The letterforms themselves are based on a geometric construction, with clean lines and sharp corners, giving the font a strong and confident presence. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at large sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly aggressive. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Gallagher versatile for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines to playful branding. Its retro vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia for the 1970s and 80s, while its bold and confident character feels distinctly modern. Gallagher is a font that demands attention, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of playful personality.",
