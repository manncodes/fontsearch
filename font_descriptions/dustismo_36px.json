    "detailed_description": "Dustismo is a contemporary italic typeface that blends a classic calligraphic sensibility with a modern, digital aesthetic. Its flowing strokes and gentle curves evoke the elegance of traditional script fonts, but its clean, consistent construction and subtle geometric undertones give it a contemporary edge. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly formal or sterile. Dustismo's overall character is one of confident sophistication, suggesting a balance between tradition and innovation. It evokes a sense of timeless elegance, yet its digital-native design makes it feel fresh and relevant for contemporary projects. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps.",
