    "detailed_description": "Korniik is a bold, sans-serif typeface that embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by thick, chunky strokes with pronounced serifs, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering or signage. The letterforms are geometrically based, with sharp angles and a consistent weight distribution, creating a sense of solidity and strength. The overall effect is one of ruggedness and authenticity, with a distinct grunge-inspired feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its bold character and gritty texture lend themselves to projects that require a strong visual impact, conveying a sense of power, rebellion, or urban grit. Korniik's design evokes a sense of nostalgia for industrial design and the DIY aesthetic, while also feeling contemporary and relevant in its use of bold, graphic forms. It's a versatile font that can be used to create a range of visual effects, from edgy and rebellious to nostalgic and authentic.",
