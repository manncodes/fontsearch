    "detailed_description": "Dendritic Voltage is a geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both retrofuturism and contemporary digital design. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are often cut at a sharp angle, adding a sense of dynamism and energy. While the overall aesthetic is bold and assertive, the font's rounded corners and subtle variations in stroke weight create a sense of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Dendritic Voltage suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital art. The font's retrofuturistic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, while its contemporary design language makes it feel relevant and fresh. It's a versatile typeface that can be used to create a range of moods, from playful and energetic to serious and sophisticated.",
