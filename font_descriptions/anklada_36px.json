    "detailed_description": "Anklada is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. Anklada's versatility extends to its ability to convey both professionalism and a sense of approachability, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of efficiency and innovation, while the subtle warmth of its rounded terminals suggests a human touch, creating a balance between functionality and personality.",
