    "detailed_description": "Immortal is a serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a contemporary edge. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif design principles, featuring a moderate x-height, balanced proportions, and a subtle contrast between thick and thin strokes. The serifs themselves are delicate and slightly bracketed, adding a touch of refinement. However, the overall feel is not overly formal, as the letterforms exhibit a slight geometric influence, particularly in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', which have a more rounded and open construction. This subtle blend of classic and modern elements gives Immortal a timeless quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its legibility is excellent, thanks to the open counters and well-defined letterforms, making it ideal for both print and digital media. The font's personality is both sophisticated and approachable, evoking a sense of tradition while remaining fresh and contemporary. It's a versatile choice for branding, editorial design, and even web interfaces, where its clean lines and subtle details can add a touch of class without feeling overly formal.",
