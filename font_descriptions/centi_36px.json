    "detailed_description": "Centi is a playful script font that blends a classic calligraphic feel with a modern, digital aesthetic. Its flowing strokes and rounded terminals evoke a sense of handwritten informality, while its consistent weight and clean construction ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's generous x-height and open counters contribute to its readability, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Centi's playful personality is further enhanced by its inclusion of ligatures and alternate glyphs, allowing for creative variations and a personalized touch. The font's overall character suggests a sense of warmth and approachability, making it ideal for projects that require a friendly and engaging tone. Its contemporary relevance is evident in its versatility, adapting well to both traditional print media and digital interfaces, particularly in branding, social media graphics, and website design.",
