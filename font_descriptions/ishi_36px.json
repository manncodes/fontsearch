    "detailed_description": "Ishi is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design principles. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, angular shapes, with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical strokes. This geometric foundation gives the font a sense of order and clarity, making it highly legible even at small sizes. However, Ishi's design is not entirely rigid. Subtle curves and rounded terminals soften the edges, adding a touch of approachability and preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Ishi a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for more human-centric projects. Ishi's geometric construction and bold forms evoke a sense of modernity and technological advancement, making it a fitting choice for projects that require a contemporary and forward-thinking aesthetic. It also carries a subtle retro vibe, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and the minimalist design trends of the 1980s, adding a layer of nostalgia to its contemporary appeal.",
