    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms and pronounced 3D effect, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The characters are constructed with sharp angles and clean lines, creating a sense of solidity and structure. The exaggerated depth of the 3D effect adds a playful dimension, suggesting movement and dynamism. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's bold personality and playful energy make it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact, such as branding, posters, and digital interfaces. Its retro-futuristic vibe evokes a sense of nostalgia for the 1970s and 1980s, while its clean lines and modern construction ensure its relevance in contemporary design.",
