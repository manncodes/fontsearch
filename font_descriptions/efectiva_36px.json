    "detailed_description": "Effectiva is a bold, sans-serif typeface that combines a geometric construction with playful, rounded details. The letters are built on a strong, consistent grid, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of approachability and dynamism, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and playful curves gives Effectiva a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to playful illustrations and digital interfaces. The font's bold weight and confident presence evoke a sense of energy and optimism, while its rounded details suggest a friendly and approachable tone. This combination makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact without sacrificing accessibility.",
