    "detailed_description": "Amette is a flowing script typeface that captures the elegance of traditional calligraphy while maintaining a contemporary feel. Its fluid strokes and graceful curves are reminiscent of handwritten script, but the carefully balanced proportions and consistent letterforms ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's distinctive features include its high x-height, which gives it a sense of openness and airiness, and its subtly rounded terminals, which add a touch of warmth and approachability. The overall effect is one of sophistication and charm, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from wedding invitations and branding to website headers and social media graphics. Amette's delicate yet confident character evokes a sense of timeless elegance, suggesting a connection to classic design traditions while remaining fresh and modern. Its versatility allows it to be used in both formal and informal contexts, adding a touch of personality and sophistication to any project.",
