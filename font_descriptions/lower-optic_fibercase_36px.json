    "detailed_description": "Lower-optic Fiberease is a bold, playful display font that draws inspiration from both retro video game aesthetics and contemporary digital design. Its geometric construction, with sharp corners and distinct shapes, creates a strong visual impact, reminiscent of pixelated graphics. The font's exaggerated proportions, particularly the high x-height and wide counters, contribute to its playful and energetic character. The rounded terminals and slightly curved strokes add a touch of approachability, softening the otherwise rigid geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and organic curves creates a unique visual tension that is both eye-catching and engaging. Fiberease's bold weight and large size make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other attention-grabbing applications. Its playful nature makes it suitable for projects targeting younger audiences or those seeking a fun and energetic aesthetic. The font's digital origins and retro-inspired design evoke a sense of nostalgia and playful energy, making it a perfect choice for projects that want to capture a sense of fun and excitement.",
