    "detailed_description": "Long Shot is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost pixelated aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with minimal curves. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its bold and assertive presence. The overall design is clean and uncluttered, with a strong emphasis on legibility, even at small sizes. The font's personality is both modern and retro, evoking a sense of digital futurism while also referencing the pixelated graphics of early video games. This duality makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital art. Its strong visual impact and clear legibility make it particularly effective for conveying a sense of energy, innovation, and technological advancement.",
