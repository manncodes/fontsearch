    "detailed_description": "Katrina is a serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif design principles, featuring a high x-height, balanced proportions, and a consistent stroke weight. The serifs are subtly bracketed, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise geometric forms. The overall character is refined and sophisticated, yet the font's legibility and versatility make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong structure lend themselves well to both print and digital media, while the subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly formal or cold. Katrina's versatility allows it to seamlessly transition from elegant branding to clear website copy, evoking a sense of timeless quality and understated sophistication.",
