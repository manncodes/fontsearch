    "detailed_description": "Acorn is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its geometric construction and subtle humanist details. The letters are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and consistent appearance. The circular forms, particularly in the lowercase 'o' and 'a', are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness gives Acorn a unique personality, making it feel both modern and timeless. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its clean lines and simple forms make it versatile for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps. Acorn's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of clarity and sophistication, suggesting a brand or project that is both innovative and reliable.",
