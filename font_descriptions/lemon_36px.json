    "detailed_description": "Lemon is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, angular forms and a distinct lack of curves. The letterforms are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a strong, modern aesthetic. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility, while the open counters enhance its clarity, especially at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of confidence and clarity, with a touch of retrofuturistic charm. Lemon's bold, geometric nature makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of futuristic optimism, reminiscent of 1980s science fiction and early computer interfaces. However, its clean lines and strong legibility also make it adaptable to contemporary design trends, particularly in the realm of technology and innovation.",
