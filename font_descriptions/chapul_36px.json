    "detailed_description": "Chapul is a handwritten script font that captures the casual charm of everyday writing. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms evoke the spontaneity of penmanship, creating a sense of warmth and authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly rounded terminals and playful ascenders and descenders add a touch of whimsy, while the overall consistency of the stroke weight maintains a sense of balance and readability. Chapul's informal character makes it ideal for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone, such as branding for small businesses, social media graphics, or handwritten notes. Its versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from casual invitations to playful website designs, adding a touch of personality to any project.",
