    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold expression of urban energy, drawing heavily from the visual language of graffiti and street art. Its construction is highly organic, with each letterform feeling like a unique, hand-drawn stroke. The exaggerated angles, sharp terminals, and dramatic curves create a sense of dynamic movement and raw energy. The font's irregular baseline and inconsistent letter spacing further contribute to its chaotic yet captivating aesthetic. While technically challenging to read in large blocks of text, its impact lies in its ability to capture attention and convey a sense of rebellion and individuality. This makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where visual impact is paramount. Its cultural resonance lies in its connection to street culture and the DIY spirit, evoking a sense of authenticity and underground expression.",
