    "detailed_description": "AXR Airpena 36px is a display typeface that blends a playful, almost cartoonish aesthetic with a touch of vintage charm. Its construction is characterized by bold, geometric shapes with exaggerated curves and sharp angles, giving it a distinct, almost whimsical personality. The exaggerated curves in letters like 'C' and 'S' add a sense of movement and energy, while the sharp angles in letters like 'M' and 'W' create a sense of strength and structure. The overall effect is a font that is both eye-catching and engaging, with a strong sense of personality. The font's bold, geometric forms make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other display applications where it can command attention. Its playful nature makes it suitable for projects that require a touch of whimsy or a retro feel. However, its exaggerated forms and sharp angles may make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes.",
