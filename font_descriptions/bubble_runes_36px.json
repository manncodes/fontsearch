The glyphs are constructed with a strong emphasis on angularity and sharp transitions, creating a sense of power and authority. The thick strokes and generous x-height contribute to a bold presence, while the open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is both ancient and modern, evoking a sense of mystery and intrigue while remaining accessible and engaging. Its bold and graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's cultural associations with ancient Norse mythology and its contemporary relevance to modern design trends make it a versatile tool for expressing a range of ideas and emotions.",
