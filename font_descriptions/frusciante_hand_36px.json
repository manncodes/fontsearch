    "detailed_description": "Frusciante Hand is a handwritten script font that captures the raw energy and individuality of its namesake. The letterforms are fluid and expressive, with a distinct lack of uniformity that adds to its authenticity. The ascenders and descenders are generously proportioned, creating a sense of dynamism and movement. The font's irregular baseline and varying stroke weights contribute to its hand-drawn aesthetic, making it feel personal and intimate. While the overall impression is casual and approachable, the font's legibility remains strong, thanks to its clear letterforms and consistent spacing. This makes it suitable for a range of applications, from personal notes and social media posts to branding projects that seek a touch of authenticity and personality. The font's inherent informality evokes a sense of spontaneity and creativity, suggesting a connection to artistic expression and personal storytelling.",
