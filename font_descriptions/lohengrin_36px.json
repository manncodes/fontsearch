    "detailed_description": "Lohengrin is a blackletter typeface that blends traditional gothic forms with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in the classic blackletter style, featuring sharp angles, pronounced serifs, and intricate ligatures. However, the design incorporates subtle humanist details, such as slightly rounded terminals and a more open counter structure, which softens the overall impression. This balance between historical authenticity and modern legibility makes Lohengrin a versatile choice for a range of applications. Its bold strokes and strong verticality convey a sense of authority and tradition, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of approachability and warmth. Lohengrin is well-suited for display purposes, particularly in headlines, logos, and branding materials where its distinctive character can make a strong visual impact. It can also be used effectively in body text, especially at larger sizes, where its legibility remains strong. However, its intricate details and bold strokes may make it less suitable for very small sizes or extended reading.",
