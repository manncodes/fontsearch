    "detailed_description": "Egyptienne is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a classic, almost monumental presence. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, with clean, sharp lines and a strong, consistent stroke weight. The letterforms are tightly spaced, creating a dense and impactful visual. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The distinctive features include the squared terminals, the slightly rounded corners on the lowercase letters, and the unique, almost architectural, structure of the uppercase 'A' and 'M'. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanist details gives Egyptienne a timeless quality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold presence and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display purposes, while its clean lines and geometric structure lend themselves well to digital interfaces and modern design aesthetics. The font evokes a sense of authority and confidence, suggesting a brand that is both traditional and forward-thinking. Its strong, almost architectural presence evokes a sense of permanence and stability, while its geometric structure suggests a modern, digital-native sensibility.",
