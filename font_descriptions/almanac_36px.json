    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, angular forms and distressed texture, embodies a raw, industrial aesthetic. The letterforms are constructed with a strong geometric foundation, featuring sharp corners and a consistent stroke width throughout. This creates a sense of rigidity and power, reminiscent of heavy machinery or urban structures. The distressed texture, achieved through subtle imperfections and rough edges, adds a layer of grit and authenticity, suggesting a history of use and wear. This combination of geometric precision and textural roughness creates a unique tension, balancing order and chaos. The font's bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and graphic design projects that require a strong visual impact. Its industrial character evokes a sense of strength, resilience, and authenticity, making it suitable for projects related to construction, manufacturing, or urban culture.",
