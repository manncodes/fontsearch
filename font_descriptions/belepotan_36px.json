    "detailed_description": "Belepotan is a playful script font that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its organic curves and uneven strokes create a sense of spontaneity and personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, while the occasional flourishes and swashes inject a dose of whimsy. Belepotan's casual charm makes it ideal for branding projects that require a friendly and approachable tone. It's particularly well-suited for headlines, logos, and social media graphics, where its informal character can add a touch of personality. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from playful children's books to edgy fashion campaigns. Belepotan's hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and creativity, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level.",
