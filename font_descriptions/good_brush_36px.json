    "detailed_description": "Good Brush is a display typeface that captures the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes, varying weights, and expressive angles evoke the immediacy of brush calligraphy. The font's construction is based on a dynamic, gestural approach, with each letterform feeling like a unique brushstroke. This results in a highly expressive and visually engaging typeface, perfect for adding a touch of personality and authenticity to designs. The font's bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements, particularly in contexts where a sense of energy and individuality is desired. While its legibility is best at larger sizes, Good Brush can be used effectively for short bursts of text, adding a touch of hand-crafted charm to digital and print projects. The font's raw, unrefined aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and creativity, reminiscent of street art and DIY culture, making it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of individuality and artistic expression.",
