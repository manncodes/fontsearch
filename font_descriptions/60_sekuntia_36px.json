    "detailed_description": "60 Sekuntia is a bold, heavily distressed display typeface that channels the raw energy of punk rock and street art. Its chunky, geometric letterforms are built with sharp angles and jagged edges, creating a sense of urgency and rebellion. The font's defining characteristic is its extensive use of distressed textures, mimicking the effects of spray paint, torn paper, and other urban elements. These textures add a layer of grit and authenticity, further enhancing its rebellious aesthetic. While the font's bold weight and aggressive styling make it ideal for eye-catching headlines and branding, its legibility can be compromised at smaller sizes due to the intricate details and heavy textures. 60 Sekuntia's raw energy and rebellious spirit make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of defiance, individuality, and urban cool. It's a font that speaks to a generation that embraces imperfection and celebrates the beauty of the raw and unpolished.",
