    "detailed_description": "Crop Types is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its circular forms are built on a grid, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slight curves and rounded terminals soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. This combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Crop Types suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of simplicity and efficiency, while its subtle curves suggest a touch of playfulness. The font's versatility and contemporary feel make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
