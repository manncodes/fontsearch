    "detailed_description": "Balakhani is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural proportions of the letterforms, particularly in the uppercase. The rounded terminals, however, introduce a slight humanist element, softening the otherwise stark geometric structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization creates a typeface that feels both contemporary and approachable. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. The overall character of Balakhani is one of clarity and confidence, suggesting a sense of professionalism and modernity. Its clean lines and balanced proportions evoke a sense of order and efficiency, while the subtle warmth of the rounded terminals adds a touch of approachability and human connection. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of sophistication and accessibility.",
