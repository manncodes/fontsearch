    "detailed_description": "FV Granada exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to its high legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Granada a contemporary feel, suggesting a blend of modern efficiency and classic elegance. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and web applications.",
