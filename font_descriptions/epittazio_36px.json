    "detailed_description": "Epittazio is a serif typeface that blends classic elegance with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional letterforms, featuring a high x-height and generous counters that ensure readability even at small sizes. The serifs are delicate and slightly bracketed, adding a touch of refinement. The overall proportions are balanced and harmonious, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, Epittazio avoids being overly formal or rigid. The subtle curves in the letterforms, particularly in the lowercase, introduce a hint of playfulness and warmth. This balance between structure and fluidity gives Epittazio a timeless appeal, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its classic elegance makes it ideal for branding, editorial design, and high-end packaging, while its contemporary sensibility allows it to seamlessly integrate into digital interfaces and web design. Epittazio evokes a sense of sophistication and refinement, suggesting a brand or message that is both timeless and relevant.",
