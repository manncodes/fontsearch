    "detailed_description": "Foglihten Black PCS is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong presence. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, proportions, with a high x-height and open counters that contribute to its excellent legibility. The letterforms are clean and uncluttered, with sharp terminals and a consistent stroke weight that gives the font a sense of solidity and authority. The overall character is confident and modern, with a hint of retro influence that evokes the bold graphic design of the mid-20th century. This combination of technical precision and design personality makes Foglihten Black PCS suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold weight and clear forms ensure it remains legible even at small sizes, while its contemporary aesthetic makes it feel fresh and relevant. The font's strong presence and confident character suggest a brand or message that is both authoritative and approachable, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a bold and impactful visual identity.",
