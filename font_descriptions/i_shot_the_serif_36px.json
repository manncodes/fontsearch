    "detailed_description": "This sans-serif typeface exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a strong emphasis on clarity and legibility. The letterforms are composed of simple, well-defined shapes, with minimal ornamentation or embellishment. The overall impression is one of modernity and efficiency, reflecting a design sensibility rooted in the principles of functionalism. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its readability, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. The consistent stroke weights and sharp terminals lend a sense of precision and order, while the slightly rounded corners soften the overall aesthetic, preventing it from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanization makes the font versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and signage. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and trustworthiness, making it a reliable choice for projects that require a modern and impactful visual identity.",
