    "detailed_description": "Herald Square is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a classic, yet modern aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, with clean lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letters are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall geometric feel. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Herald Square a distinctive character, making it both authoritative and approachable. The font's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, while its clean lines and legibility ensure its effectiveness in digital interfaces and print materials. Herald Square evokes a sense of confidence and modernity, reminiscent of mid-century design but with a contemporary edge. Its bold, geometric forms suggest a sense of strength and stability, while its subtle humanism adds a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it a versatile typeface suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to editorial design.",
