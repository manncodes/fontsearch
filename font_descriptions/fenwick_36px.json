    "detailed_description": "Fenwick is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, double-lined construction. This distinctive feature creates a sense of visual weight and solidity, lending itself to applications where a strong presence is desired. The geometric construction of the letterforms, particularly evident in the sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, contributes to a clean and modern aesthetic. While the overall impression is one of boldness and clarity, the subtle curves in the terminals of letters like 'C' and 'G' introduce a touch of approachability, preventing the typeface from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Fenwick versatile, suitable for both large-scale headlines and smaller text blocks. Its bold presence evokes a sense of confidence and authority, making it ideal for branding, advertising, and editorial design. The double-lined construction also lends itself to digital applications, particularly in user interfaces where clear visual hierarchy is crucial. The typeface's contemporary aesthetic and bold character suggest a connection to the digital age, while its clean lines and strong legibility ensure readability across various screen sizes.",
