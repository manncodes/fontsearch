    "detailed_description": "This font, built upon a geometric construction, presents a stark and angular aesthetic. Its sharp corners and straight lines create a sense of rigidity and precision, reminiscent of early digital typography or even the architectural style of brutalism. The consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs contribute to a clean, uncluttered appearance, emphasizing clarity and functionality. While the overall impression is one of starkness, the font's open counters and generous x-height ensure good legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text. The font's bold, assertive character makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. It evokes a sense of modernity and technological advancement, suggesting a connection to the digital age and its emphasis on efficiency and functionality.",
