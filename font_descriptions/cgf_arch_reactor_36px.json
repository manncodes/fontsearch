    "detailed_description": "Arch Reactor is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated angles and a strong emphasis on verticality. This creates a sense of power and authority, while the open counters and generous x-height ensure good legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's bold weight and striking design make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts that require a strong visual impact. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of science fiction films and 1980s design trends. While its bold nature might limit its use in extended body text, Arch Reactor excels in creating a strong visual identity for projects that demand a confident and futuristic aesthetic.",
