    "detailed_description": "Krasomila is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its strong, consistent stroke weights and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in letters like 'a' and 'g' add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Krasomila suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it feel welcoming and engaging. Krasomila's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of clarity, personality, and cultural relevance.",
