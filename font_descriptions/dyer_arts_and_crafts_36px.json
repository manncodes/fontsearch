    "detailed_description": "Dyer Arts and Crafts is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, almost architectural presence. Its construction is based on precise angles and clean lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are composed of simple, geometric shapes, with minimal curves or embellishments.
