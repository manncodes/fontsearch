    "detailed_description": "X. Anggaran Dasar is a blackletter typeface that blends traditional gothic forms with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in classic blackletter anatomy, featuring sharp, angular strokes and intricate flourishes. The ascenders and descenders are elongated, creating a sense of verticality and grandeur. However, the font's overall proportions are balanced, preventing it from feeling overly ornate or heavy. The lowercase letters are particularly well-crafted, with subtle variations in stroke weight and curvature that add visual interest and readability. The font's design personality is both authoritative and approachable, evoking a sense of history and tradition while remaining accessible and modern. Its sharp angles and bold strokes convey a sense of strength and power, while the subtle curves and flourishes add a touch of elegance and sophistication. X. Anggaran Dasar is well-suited for a variety of applications, from branding and editorial design to packaging and signage. Its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines and titles, while its legibility allows it to be used effectively in body text, especially at larger sizes. The font's cultural associations are rich and varied, drawing inspiration from medieval manuscripts and gothic architecture while also reflecting contemporary trends in design. It evokes a sense of mystery and intrigue, suggesting a connection to the past while remaining relevant to the present.",
