    "detailed_description": "Ghoulsih Fright AOE is a display typeface that leans heavily into a cartoonish, almost grotesque aesthetic. Its bold, chunky letterforms are built with exaggerated curves and sharp angles, creating a sense of playful distortion. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at large sizes, while the uneven stroke weights and exaggerated terminals add a touch of whimsy. This combination of bold forms and playful details makes it ideal for eye-catching headlines, logos, and branding elements that demand attention. The font's playful nature evokes a sense of fun and irreverence, reminiscent of classic cartoon characters and vintage horror movie posters. Its bold, almost menacing character suggests a sense of playful danger, making it suitable for projects that aim to capture a sense of excitement and intrigue.",
