    "detailed_description": "Florence is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a contemporary yet timeless aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and precise angles, provides a sense of order and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. While the overall structure is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in certain lowercase letters, add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Florence a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean and modern aesthetic aligns well with contemporary design trends, while its timeless qualities ensure its longevity. Florence's versatility makes it ideal for branding, web design, editorial layouts, and even user interface design, where its clear legibility and approachable personality enhance user experience.",
