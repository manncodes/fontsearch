    "detailed_description": "Drunk Millionaire is a display typeface that embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic. Its bold, geometric forms are reminiscent of stencil lettering, but with a distinct grunge twist. The letters are constructed with sharp, angular strokes and open counters, creating a sense of immediacy and impact. The defining characteristic of the font is its heavily distressed texture, achieved through the application of a spray paint effect. This texture adds a layer of grit and authenticity, suggesting a rebellious and street-inspired vibe. The font's overall character is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of power and confidence. It draws inspiration from the rebellious spirit of punk rock and street art, reflecting a countercultural attitude. While its distressed texture might seem chaotic, the underlying geometric structure ensures legibility, making it suitable for headlines, posters, and branding projects that demand a strong visual presence. The font's raw energy and rebellious spirit make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of authenticity and defiance.",
