    "detailed_description": "Aissur is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are often cut off abruptly, adding a sense of dynamism and energy. This combination of geometric precision and playful asymmetry creates a unique visual identity, reminiscent of early computer graphics and 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. Aissur's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a statement-making visual impact. Its retro-futuristic vibe also lends itself well to digital interfaces, video games, and other contemporary applications where a sense of playful energy is desired.",
