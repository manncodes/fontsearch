    "detailed_description": "The font \"Bloody\" is a bold display typeface that embodies a raw, visceral energy. Its defining characteristic is the dripping effect, achieved through exaggerated, uneven strokes that mimic dripping blood or paint. This creates a sense of movement and immediacy, adding a dramatic flair to any design. The letterforms themselves are based on a simple, almost childlike hand-drawn aesthetic, with rounded corners and a slightly uneven baseline. This contrast between the crude, almost amateurish construction and the dramatic dripping effect creates a unique tension, making the font both playful and unsettling. While the dripping effect is visually striking, it can be challenging to read in smaller sizes or complex layouts. However, its impact in large sizes, particularly for headlines or posters, is undeniable. \"Bloody\" evokes a sense of danger and excitement, reminiscent of horror movies or underground punk culture. Its bold, unapologetic style makes it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of raw energy.",
