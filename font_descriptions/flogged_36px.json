    "detailed_description": "Flogged is a display typeface that embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a series of sharp, angular strokes, creating a sense of immediacy and impact. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated ascenders and descenders, and a pronounced contrast between thick and thin strokes. This contrast, combined with the jagged edges and uneven spacing, contributes to the font's aggressive and rebellious character. While the overall design is highly stylized, the font maintains a degree of legibility, particularly at larger sizes. This makes it suitable for headlines, posters, and other applications where visual impact is paramount. The font's aggressive nature evokes a sense of rebellion and defiance, reminiscent of punk rock aesthetics and underground culture. It suggests a raw, unfiltered energy, and a disregard for conventional norms. Flogged is a powerful tool for conveying a message of intensity and disruption, making it ideal for projects that demand a bold and uncompromising visual identity.",
