    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric construction, with each letterform built from sharp angles and distinct cuts. The overall effect is one of angularity and power, reminiscent of early video game graphics or futuristic sci-fi designs. The heavy weight and consistent stroke width contribute to a sense of solidity and strength, while the sharp terminals and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's bold personality makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that demand attention and a sense of authority. Its futuristic aesthetic aligns well with technology-focused brands, gaming projects, and any design that seeks to convey a sense of innovation and power.",
