    "detailed_description": "Angioma AOE is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost whimsical, approach to letterforms. Its construction is based on a series of parallel lines, creating a distinctive, almost 3D effect. This technique results in a bold, graphic presence, particularly noticeable in the uppercase letters. The lines are not perfectly straight, adding a subtle hand-drawn quality that softens the overall impression. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to good legibility even at smaller sizes. The open counters and generous spacing between letters further enhance readability. While the font's bold character makes it suitable for headlines and branding elements, its playful nature also lends itself to more creative applications, such as illustrations or graphic design projects. The overall impression is one of a font that is both eye-catching and approachable, suggesting a sense of fun and energy.",
