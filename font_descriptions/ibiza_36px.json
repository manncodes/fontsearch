    "detailed_description": "Ibiza is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a confident yet approachable aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, lends a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism is further emphasized by the font's high x-height, which ensures strong legibility even at smaller sizes. The overall character of Ibiza is one of modern sophistication, suggesting a blend of classic design principles with contemporary sensibilities. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying information clearly, while its subtle warmth and approachability create a welcoming and engaging experience.",
