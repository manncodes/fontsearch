    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Gravestones 3\", is a bold and playful display typeface that uses the iconic image of a tombstone as its primary design element. Each letterform is constructed within the silhouette of a tombstone, featuring a rounded top, a rectangular base, and a prominent cross at the apex. The construction is geometric, with sharp corners and a consistent width across all characters, creating a strong and easily recognizable visual identity. The font's bold weight and high x-height ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. The playful nature of the design, however, lends itself to more whimsical uses, such as Halloween decorations, spooky-themed branding, or even children's books. The font's cultural associations are primarily with death, the afterlife, and the macabre, but its playful execution softens these connotations, making it more approachable and even humorous. The font's technical limitations lie in its limited character set and its lack of stylistic alternates, which may restrict its use in more complex typographic layouts.",
