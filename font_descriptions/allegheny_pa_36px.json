    "detailed_description": "Allegheny is a bold display typeface that draws inspiration from classic blackletter styles, but with a contemporary twist. Its sharp, angular strokes and dramatic serifs create a strong visual impact, reminiscent of medieval manuscripts and gothic architecture. However, the font's overall proportions are more balanced and less condensed than traditional blackletter, making it more legible and adaptable for modern applications. The high x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, while the exaggerated ascenders and descenders add a touch of playful energy. This combination of historical influence and contemporary sensibility makes Allegheny suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and packaging to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its bold character and striking aesthetic evoke a sense of power, tradition, and a touch of rebelliousness, making it ideal for projects that demand attention and a strong visual presence.",
