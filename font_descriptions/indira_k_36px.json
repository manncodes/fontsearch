    "detailed_description": "Indira K is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, giving it a strong, confident presence. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing it from feeling overly sterile. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. Indira K's overall character evokes a sense of clarity and professionalism, while its subtle humanist details suggest a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a modern, clean aesthetic without sacrificing readability or personality.",
