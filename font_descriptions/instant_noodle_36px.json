    "detailed_description": "Instant Noodle is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a playful yet refined aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the consistent stroke widths and sharp corners, provides a clean and modern feel. However, the subtle curves in the terminals and the slight humanist slant in the letterforms add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale headlines and smaller body text. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a range of punctuation marks and symbols, making it well-suited for a variety of digital and print applications. Instant Noodle's overall character evokes a sense of playful sophistication, reminiscent of the design trends of the 1960s and 1970s, yet with a contemporary edge. Its clean lines and bold presence suggest a sense of confidence and optimism, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and visual impact.",
