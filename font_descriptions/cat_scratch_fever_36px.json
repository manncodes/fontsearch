    "detailed_description": "\u201cGet Scratch Fever\u201d is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost chaotic energy. Its construction relies heavily on geometric shapes, with letters formed from sharp angles and bold strokes. This creates a sense of immediacy and visual impact, reminiscent of street art or graffiti. The font's distinctive feature is its use of exaggerated angles and sharp corners, which give it a dynamic and almost aggressive feel. While the overall design is bold and assertive, the font also incorporates subtle details, such as slight variations in stroke thickness and the occasional rounded corner, which add a touch of humanity and prevent it from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes the font versatile, suitable for eye-catching headlines, bold branding elements, or even playful illustrations. Its bold, energetic character evokes a sense of youthful rebellion and urban grit, making it ideal for projects that want to convey a sense of excitement, energy, and individuality. ",
