    "detailed_description": "Coventry Garden 36pv is a display typeface that blends classic Art Deco influences with a playful, almost whimsical touch. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean lines and symmetrical forms, particularly in the uppercase letters. The rounded terminals and subtle curves, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability. The font's distinctive feature is the inclusion of decorative flourishes on the lowercase letters, adding a sense of elegance and sophistication. These flourishes, while intricate, are carefully balanced to avoid overwhelming the overall design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. This makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from branding and packaging to headlines and signage. The overall effect is a font that feels both timeless and contemporary, evoking a sense of vintage charm with a modern twist. Its playful nature makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and whimsy, while its classic elegance ensures it remains sophisticated and refined.",
