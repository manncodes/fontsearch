    "detailed_description": "Birdman is a bold, futuristic display typeface that leans heavily on geometric construction. Its characters are built from sharp angles and straight lines, creating a sense of speed and dynamism. The font's distinctive feature is its pronounced slant, which adds a sense of motion and energy. The consistent stroke weight and open counters contribute to its legibility, even at smaller sizes. Birdman's overall character is confident and assertive, evoking a sense of technological advancement and futuristic design. It draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1980s, particularly the use of bold geometric forms and vibrant colors. This font is particularly well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold, futuristic aesthetic makes it ideal for projects related to technology, science fiction, and gaming. The font's sharp angles and dynamic slant create a sense of movement and energy, making it perfect for conveying a sense of speed and innovation.",
