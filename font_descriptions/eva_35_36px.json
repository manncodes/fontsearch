    "detailed_description": "Eva 35 is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of humanist warmth. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, proportions, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, unornamented terminals. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, while the open counters enhance readability even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of clarity and efficiency, yet the subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a hint of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Eva 35 suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying professionalism and modernity, while its subtle warmth ensures a welcoming and approachable feel. The font's contemporary relevance is undeniable, reflecting the current trend towards minimalist design and digital-native aesthetics. It evokes a sense of efficiency and clarity, aligning with the values of contemporary technology and communication.",
