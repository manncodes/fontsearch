    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a striking combination of geometric precision and subtle humanist touches. Its construction is primarily geometric, with characters built from straight lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of clarity and order. However, the slight rounding of terminals and the delicate curves in certain letters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, with a hint of retro charm. The font's clean lines and balanced proportions evoke a sense of efficiency and professionalism, while the subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly sterile. It's a versatile typeface that can be used for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to editorial design, and its contemporary aesthetic makes it particularly well-suited for digital interfaces and web design.",
