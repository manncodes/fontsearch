    "detailed_description": "Etharnig is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of vintage charm. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail gives Etharnig a versatile personality, suitable for both contemporary and traditional applications. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and print materials alike. Its clean lines and neutral character evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while the subtle curves suggest a touch of playfulness and approachability. Etharnig's design echoes the minimalist aesthetic of mid-century modernism, yet its clean lines and versatility make it feel distinctly contemporary. It's a font that can be used to create a sense of sophistication and modernity, while still maintaining a sense of warmth and approachability.",
