    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with characters constructed from precise, almost architectural lines. The letterforms are primarily rectangular, with sharp corners and minimal curves. This creates a sense of order and clarity, reminiscent of early digital interfaces or modernist design principles. The consistent stroke weight and uniform spacing contribute to a sense of balance and stability, making the font feel both authoritative and approachable. While the overall aesthetic is clean and modern, subtle details like the slightly rounded terminals on lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and prevent the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. The font's clean lines and strong legibility ensure readability even at small sizes, while its modern aesthetic aligns with contemporary design trends.",
