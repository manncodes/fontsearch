    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Death Font\", embodies a stark and uncompromising aesthetic. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and pronounced serifs, creates a sense of rigidity and authority. The heavy weight and condensed proportions further amplify this impression, lending a sense of power and dominance. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing, contributing to the overall feeling of density and intensity. The rough, textured edges, reminiscent of hand-carved wood or stone, add a raw, unrefined quality, suggesting a sense of age and history. This font is not for the faint of heart, its boldness and starkness make it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a strong message. It could be used effectively for branding, posters, or headlines, particularly in contexts related to power, rebellion, or the macabre.",
