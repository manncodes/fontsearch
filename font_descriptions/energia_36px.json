    "detailed_description": "Energia is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct 3D extrusion effect. Its construction is based on clean, rectangular shapes with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight. The extrusion adds a sense of depth and dimension, creating a dynamic and almost futuristic feel. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy. It evokes a sense of retro-futurism, reminiscent of 80s video game graphics and cyberpunk aesthetics. Energia is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact and a sense of technological advancement. Its bold presence and unique style make it ideal for capturing attention and conveying a sense of power and innovation.",
