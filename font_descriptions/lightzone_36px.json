    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct geometric construction, with characters built from a series of straight lines and sharp angles. The consistent stroke weight and uniform letterforms create a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early digital typography. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. While the overall impression is clean and modern, the subtle variations in letterform proportions, such as the slightly wider 'W' and the angled terminals of the 'A', add a touch of visual interest and prevent the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanization gives the font a contemporary feel, suggesting both technological advancement and a touch of warmth. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts where clarity and a sense of modernity are paramount.",
