    "detailed_description": "Just Kids is a playful display font that embraces a cartoonish aesthetic. Its rounded forms and exaggerated curves create a sense of childlike energy and whimsy. The font's construction is based on simple, organic shapes, with each letterform feeling hand-drawn and slightly irregular. This adds to its charm and reinforces its informal character. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines and short bursts of text. While its primary appeal lies in its playful nature, Just Kids can also be used for more sophisticated applications, adding a touch of personality and humor to branding or editorial design. Its bold, expressive forms evoke a sense of fun and nostalgia, reminiscent of classic cartoon characters and children's book illustrations. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects targeting a younger audience or aiming to convey a lighthearted and approachable tone.",
