    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric simplicity, built on a grid of squares with minimal variation. The letterforms are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a stark and unyielding visual impact. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The open counters and consistent stroke widths further enhance readability, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall character is assertive and confident, conveying a sense of authority and directness. It evokes a retro-futuristic aesthetic, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and 8-bit graphics, yet with a modern edge. This font is ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence, such as branding for tech companies, gaming interfaces, or bold headlines. Its digital origins and bold personality make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of innovation and cutting-edge technology.",
