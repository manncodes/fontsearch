    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric forms and pronounced 3D effect, evokes a sense of retrofuturism. The letters are constructed with sharp angles and clean lines, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. The strong, consistent stroke weight and the use of beveling create a sense of depth and solidity, adding to the futuristic feel. The overall effect is one of power and dynamism, suggesting a sense of movement and energy. While the font's bold nature makes it suitable for headlines and display purposes, its legibility is somewhat compromised by the intricate details and the 3D effect, making it less ideal for extended text. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the visual language of science fiction and cyberpunk, evoking a sense of technological advancement and a futuristic world.",
