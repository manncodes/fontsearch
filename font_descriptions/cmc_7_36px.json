    "detailed_description": "CMC 7 is a highly geometric sans-serif typeface built entirely from vertical and horizontal lines. Its construction is stark and unyielding, with no curves or serifs to soften its edges. The characters are formed by a series of parallel lines, creating a distinct, almost mechanical aesthetic. This strict geometric structure lends a sense of order and precision, making it ideal for conveying information clearly and concisely. The font's lack of ornamentation and its consistent, uniform stroke width contribute to its clean and uncluttered appearance. While its simplicity might seem austere at first glance, CMC 7 possesses a certain charm in its starkness, evoking a sense of retrofuturism and a connection to the early days of digital technology. Its bold, unadorned nature makes it particularly well-suited for applications where clarity and legibility are paramount, such as signage, data visualization, and technical documentation. However, its minimalist design also allows it to be used in more creative contexts, adding a touch of industrial chic to branding or editorial projects.",
