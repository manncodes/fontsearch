    "detailed_description": "Flores is a playful and retro display typeface that combines bold, geometric letterforms with a whimsical daisy motif. The letters are constructed with strong, clean lines and sharp corners, giving them a distinct vintage feel reminiscent of 1960s and 70s graphic design. The daisy pattern, strategically placed within the negative space of each letter, adds a touch of whimsy and charm, creating a visual contrast between the bold, geometric forms and the delicate floral detail. This combination of elements results in a typeface that is both eye-catching and approachable, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from playful branding and packaging to retro-inspired posters and website designs. The bold, graphic nature of the typeface ensures strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the daisy motif adds a touch of personality and visual interest. Flores evokes a sense of nostalgia and optimism, reminiscent of a simpler time, while also feeling fresh and contemporary in its playful execution.",
