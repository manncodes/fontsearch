    "detailed_description": "This font, with its jagged edges and distressed texture, evokes a sense of raw, unrefined energy. The letterforms are based on a geometric construction, with sharp angles and pronounced serifs, giving it a bold and assertive presence. The uneven stroke weights and rough edges contribute to a sense of urgency and immediacy, suggesting a hand-drawn quality. While the overall design is angular and aggressive, the font maintains a degree of legibility, particularly in larger sizes. This makes it suitable for headlines, posters, and branding where a strong visual impact is desired. The distressed texture adds a layer of grit and authenticity, suggesting a connection to street art, punk rock, or other subcultures that embrace a DIY aesthetic. The font's raw energy and rebellious spirit make it a powerful tool for conveying a message of defiance, individuality, and authenticity.",
