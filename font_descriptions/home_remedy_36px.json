    "detailed_description": "Home Remedy is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is based on a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines of the letterforms. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to strong legibility, while the open counters enhance readability, especially at smaller sizes. The terminals, though primarily geometric, exhibit a slight rounding, adding a touch of approachability and warmth to the overall aesthetic. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance gives Home Remedy a distinctive character, making it feel both modern and timeless. The font's clean lines and consistent weight distribution make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its versatility allows it to convey a sense of professionalism and clarity without appearing overly formal or sterile. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a brand or message that is both reliable and approachable.",
