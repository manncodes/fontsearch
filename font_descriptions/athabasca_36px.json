    "detailed_description": "Athabasca is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric sans-serifs. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly legible and consistent appearance. The letterforms are geometrically precise, with sharp corners and minimal curves, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the font avoids being overly rigid by incorporating subtle humanist details, such as slightly rounded terminals and a slight variation in stroke weight. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Athabasca a unique character, making it both professional and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers and branding to editorial design and signage. Athabasca's clean lines and modern feel make it a versatile choice for contemporary projects, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. It evokes a sense of efficiency and clarity, suggesting a forward-thinking and innovative approach.",
