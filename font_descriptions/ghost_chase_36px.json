    "detailed_description": "Ghost Chase is a display typeface that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes, jagged terminals, and inconsistent letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's construction is highly organic, with each letter appearing as a unique, expressive gesture. This lack of uniformity contributes to its raw, unpolished aesthetic, making it ideal for projects that demand a bold, edgy, and slightly chaotic visual identity. While its legibility is limited due to the extreme variations in letterforms, it excels in capturing attention and conveying a sense of urgency or rebellion. The font's rough, hand-drawn quality evokes a sense of DIY culture and underground art, making it suitable for projects that aim to communicate a sense of authenticity and unconventionality.",
