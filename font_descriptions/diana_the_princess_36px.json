    "detailed_description": "This font is a captivating blend of bold, geometric forms and subtle, humanized details. Its construction is rooted in a strong, almost architectural framework, with characters built from clean lines and precise angles. The x-height is notably high, contributing to a sense of openness and legibility, particularly in smaller sizes. The terminals, while generally sharp and angular, exhibit a slight rounding that softens the overall impression, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization creates a unique character, one that is both confident and approachable. The font's bold weight and strong verticality lend it a sense of authority and stability, making it suitable for headlines and branding applications where a commanding presence is desired. However, the subtle humanization prevents it from feeling overly formal or imposing, allowing it to be used effectively in a wider range of contexts, including editorial design and digital interfaces. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modern sophistication, suggesting a blend of classic design principles and contemporary sensibilities. It carries a subtle air of nostalgia, perhaps referencing the geometric sans-serif fonts of the mid-20th century, but with a distinctly modern edge. This makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to convey a sense of timeless elegance and forward-thinking design.",
