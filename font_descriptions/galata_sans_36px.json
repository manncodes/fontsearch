    "detailed_description": "Galata Sans embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic sans-serif design. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural, proportions of its letterforms. The terminals, while sharp, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability that softens the otherwise rigid structure. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that feels both contemporary and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed signage. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, yet approachable and inviting, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, modern look without sacrificing readability.",
