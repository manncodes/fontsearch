    "detailed_description": "Bitume is a bold, expressive typeface that blends a geometric foundation with playful, almost cartoonish distortions. Its construction is based on strong, angular shapes, evident in the sharp corners of the uppercase letters and the consistent width of the strokes. However, the font's character is defined by its exaggerated slant and the subtle, yet noticeable, distortions applied to individual letterforms. This creates a sense of movement and energy, making the font feel both dynamic and slightly off-kilter. The high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the bold weight and distinctive slant make it stand out in headlines and branding applications. Bitume's playful nature and bold presence evoke a sense of fun and irreverence, making it suitable for projects that require a touch of personality and a hint of chaos. It's a font that feels both modern and nostalgic, referencing the playful spirit of vintage comic books and graphic design while maintaining a contemporary edge.",
