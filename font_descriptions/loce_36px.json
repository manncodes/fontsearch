    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, three-dimensional construction, achieved through a series of parallel strokes that create a distinct sense of depth. The letterforms themselves are based on a geometric structure, with clean lines and sharp corners, lending a sense of precision and modernity. The overall effect is one of confident strength and visual impact, reminiscent of early computer graphics and retro-futuristic aesthetics. While the bold construction might seem imposing, the font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, making it suitable for headlines and display applications. The font's retro-futuristic vibe makes it ideal for projects that want to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the digital age, while its bold presence also lends itself to contemporary branding and design that seeks to make a statement.",
