    "detailed_description": "Complained 36px is a display typeface that embodies a playful retro aesthetic. Its rounded, geometric forms are reminiscent of 1970s and 80s design, with a strong emphasis on bold, graphic shapes. The font's construction is characterized by its consistent, almost cartoonish curves, with a slight slant adding a dynamic feel. The generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at large sizes. The overall effect is one of fun, approachable energy, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and playful branding projects. While its retro style might seem niche, its bold presence and clear legibility make it adaptable to a range of contemporary applications, particularly in digital media where its playful energy can stand out.",
