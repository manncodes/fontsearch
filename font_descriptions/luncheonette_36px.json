    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths. The uppercase letters are particularly striking, with a strong, almost architectural presence. The lowercase letters, while maintaining the geometric foundation, exhibit a subtle humanist touch, particularly in the rounded terminals of letters like 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail creates a font that is both modern and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The overall impression is one of confidence and clarity, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable. The font's bold, geometric nature evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, while the subtle humanist details add a touch of warmth and approachability. This combination makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and website design to editorial layouts and product packaging.",
