    "detailed_description": "Butter is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, slightly rounded corners of its letterforms, creating a sense of order and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The subtle humanist details, such as the slight curves in the terminals of lowercase letters, add a touch of approachability and prevent the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives Butter a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and modern feel make it ideal for contemporary branding, web design, and user interfaces, while its approachability and legibility ensure its effectiveness in print and digital publications. Butter's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests a friendly and approachable tone. It's a font that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying a sense of innovation and reliability.",
