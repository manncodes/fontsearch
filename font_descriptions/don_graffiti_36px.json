    "detailed_description": "Don Graffiti is a display typeface that captures the raw energy and expressive freedom of urban street art. Its bold, exaggerated forms are reminiscent of hand-painted graffiti, with thick strokes, sharp angles, and dynamic curves. The font's construction is largely organic, with letterforms that flow and twist, creating a sense of movement and spontaneity. The high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at large sizes, while the irregular baseline adds to the font's informal and rebellious character. Don Graffiti's bold personality makes it ideal for eye-catching headlines, branding for streetwear or urban-inspired projects, and creating a sense of rebellious energy. Its informal aesthetic and strong visual impact make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of authenticity and street credibility.",
