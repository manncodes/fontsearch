    "detailed_description": "Cimice 36px is a bold, expressive font that combines a retro-futuristic aesthetic with a playful, almost cartoonish energy. Its construction is based on a simple geometric framework, with each letterform built from a series of angled lines and curves. This creates a sense of dynamism and movement, further emphasized by the exaggerated 3D effect. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the rounded terminals and playful curves add a touch of approachability. The overall effect is one of confident energy and playful optimism, reminiscent of classic sci-fi films and video game graphics. Cimice 36px is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other display applications where its bold personality and retro charm can shine. It's particularly effective in digital contexts, where its 3D effect can be used to create engaging and interactive experiences.",
