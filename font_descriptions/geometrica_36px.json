    "detailed_description": "Geometrica is a sans-serif typeface built on a strict geometric construction, with each letterform composed of straight lines and precise angles. This creates a clean, modern aesthetic, reminiscent of early 20th-century geometric sans-serifs like Futura. The font's distinctive feature is its double-line structure, where each letter is outlined with two parallel lines, adding a sense of depth and dimensionality. This unique construction lends a technical, almost architectural feel, suggesting precision and order. While the geometric foundation provides a strong sense of structure, the slightly rounded terminals on some letters, like 'a' and 'c', introduce a subtle touch of humanism, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance makes Geometrica suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility ensure readability even at small sizes, while its unique character adds a touch of sophistication and modernity. Geometrica evokes a sense of futuristic optimism, suggesting a world built on logic and precision, yet with a subtle human touch.",
