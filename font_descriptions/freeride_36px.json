    "detailed_description": "Freeride is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built on a strong, consistent grid, with clean, crisp lines and open counters that ensure excellent legibility. The overall proportions are balanced and harmonious, with a moderate x-height and a slightly condensed character width. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and personality to the otherwise geometric structure. This combination of technical precision and subtle humanization gives Freeride a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it equally effective for smaller text sizes. Freeride's contemporary aesthetic evokes a sense of clarity and confidence, while its subtle humanization prevents it from feeling overly sterile or cold. It's a versatile font that can be used to create a range of visual styles, from minimalist and modern to more traditional and elegant.",
