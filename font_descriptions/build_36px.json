    "detailed_description": "Build (C36px) is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a confident and straightforward aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and precise angles, creates a sense of order and clarity. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The slightly rounded terminals, however, add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Build a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to editorial design. The font's bold weight and strong presence suggest a sense of authority and confidence, while its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of professionalism and innovation. Build's versatility and contemporary appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a clear, confident, and visually impactful typeface.",
