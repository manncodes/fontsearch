    "detailed_description": "Confetti Falling is a playful script font that captures the essence of handwritten informality. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms evoke the spontaneity of a quick note or a personal message. The font's organic nature is evident in the varying thicknesses of its lines, the subtle curves and angles, and the occasional flourishes. This casual aesthetic is further enhanced by the inclusion of ligatures and alternate glyphs, adding a touch of personality and visual interest. While the font's overall appearance is relaxed, it maintains a clear and legible structure, ensuring readability even in smaller sizes. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from social media posts and website headers to invitations and packaging. The font's playful nature and its ability to convey a sense of warmth and authenticity make it a perfect choice for projects that aim to connect with audiences on a personal level.",
