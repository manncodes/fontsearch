    "detailed_description": "Gurindam is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, angular forms with a slight curve to soften the edges, creating a balance between modern and vintage aesthetics. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the generous stroke weights and bold forms give it a commanding presence. The font's personality is both confident and playful, with a hint of retro charm. It evokes a sense of optimism and energy, reminiscent of 1970s science fiction and graphic design. Gurindam is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold character and retro appeal make it ideal for projects that seek to convey a sense of innovation, energy, and a touch of nostalgia.",
