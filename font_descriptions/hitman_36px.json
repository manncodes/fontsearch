    "detailed_description": "This font, with its jagged edges and irregular forms, embodies a raw, unrefined aesthetic. The letterforms are constructed with a distinct lack of precision, featuring uneven strokes and rough, almost distressed, edges. This deliberate imperfection creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering or a distressed stencil. The overall character is bold and assertive, conveying a sense of power and rebellion. The font's rough edges and unevenness suggest a sense of urgency and chaos, making it suitable for projects that require a strong, edgy visual impact. While its technical execution might not be considered traditionally refined, it's precisely this imperfection that contributes to its unique character and appeal. The font's raw energy and rebellious spirit make it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of grit, authenticity, and defiance.",
