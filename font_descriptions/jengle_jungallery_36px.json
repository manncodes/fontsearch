    "detailed_description": "Jengle is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost playful character. Its construction is based on simple, clean lines and sharp angles, giving it a modern and confident feel. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on negative space, resulting in open counters and a sense of openness. This, combined with the high x-height, ensures excellent legibility even at small sizes. The font's distinctive feature is its unique treatment of terminals, which are often cut off abruptly, creating a sense of energy and dynamism. This unexpected detail adds a touch of personality to the otherwise straightforward design. Jengle's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic make it suitable for both print and digital media, while its playful nature adds a touch of personality to any project. The font evokes a sense of confidence and energy, suggesting a brand that is bold, innovative, and unafraid to stand out.",
