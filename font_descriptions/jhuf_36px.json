    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and geometric sans-serif, built on a grid-based structure with sharp, angular terminals. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on verticality, with a high x-height and a consistent stroke weight throughout. This creates a sense of stability and power, while the clean lines and lack of ornamentation contribute to a modern and minimalist aesthetic. The font's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in digital environments where its sharp edges and clear forms translate well to screen resolutions. The font's geometric construction and lack of serifs evoke a sense of efficiency and precision, suggesting a connection to technology and the digital world. It carries a sense of confidence and authority, making it suitable for projects that require a strong and assertive visual identity.",
