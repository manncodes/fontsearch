    "detailed_description": "Leatherwork is a display typeface that blends classic serif construction with a playful, almost whimsical touch. Its rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions give it a friendly, approachable feel, while the subtle variations in stroke weight and the distinctive curves of letters like 'R' and 'S' add a touch of personality. The font's overall structure is based on a geometric framework, evident in the consistent proportions and the clean, crisp lines. However, the slight deviations from perfect geometric forms, particularly in the lowercase letters, create a sense of warmth and informality. This balance between structure and playfulness makes Leatherwork suitable for a variety of applications, from branding and logos to headlines and short-form text. Its friendly personality and clear legibility make it ideal for projects that require a touch of charm and personality, while its geometric foundation ensures a sense of professionalism and sophistication.",
