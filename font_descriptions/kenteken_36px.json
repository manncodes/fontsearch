    "detailed_description": "Kenteken 936px is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of playful personality. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural, proportions, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, well-defined terminals. The overall structure is highly legible, with a generous x-height and open counters that ensure clarity even at small sizes. However, the font's character is not solely defined by its technical precision. The rounded corners of the lowercase 'a' and 'o' introduce a subtle warmth and approachability, while the playful curves of the 'g' and 's' add a touch of whimsy. This balance between geometric rigor and organic detail makes Kenteken 936px suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying a sense of modernity and professionalism, while its subtle playful elements add a touch of personality and approachability. The font's overall character evokes a sense of optimism and confidence, suggesting a brand or message that is both forward-thinking and approachable.",
