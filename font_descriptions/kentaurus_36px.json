Its construction is based on sharp angles and precise curves, creating a sense of dynamism and energy. The letterforms are tightly spaced, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at small sizes. The slant is consistent throughout the alphabet, adding a sense of direction and momentum. The overall effect is one of confident modernity, with a touch of playful irreverence. Kentaurus is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold character and futuristic aesthetic evoke a sense of progress and innovation, making it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of speed, technology, or cutting-edge design.",
