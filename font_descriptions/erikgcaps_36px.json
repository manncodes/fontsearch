    "detailed_description": "This font, with its geometric construction and sharp terminals, exudes a sense of precision and order. The consistent stroke weight and tight letter spacing contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The uppercase letters are designed with a strong vertical emphasis, creating a sense of stability and authority. The lowercase letters, while maintaining the geometric foundation, exhibit a subtle humanist touch, particularly in the rounded terminals of letters like 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric rigor and humanist warmth gives the font a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, while its subtle warmth prevents it from feeling overly cold or sterile. The font's overall character evokes a sense of confidence and sophistication, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and grounded in tradition.",
