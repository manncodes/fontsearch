    "detailed_description": "Elegan Tech embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic sans-serif design. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural, proportions of its letterforms. The lowercase 'a' and 'g' exhibit a slight humanist touch, with their rounded terminals adding a touch of warmth to the otherwise stark geometry. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall impression is one of clarity and efficiency, suggesting a confident and professional demeanor. While its geometric foundation evokes a sense of order and precision, the subtle humanist details prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance makes it ideal for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to user interfaces, where a clean and modern aesthetic is desired without sacrificing readability or approachability.",
