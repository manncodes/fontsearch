    "detailed_description": "Folks is a bold, sans-serif typeface that exudes a playful yet confident personality. Its rounded, geometric forms are reminiscent of 1950s and 60s design, evoking a sense of optimism and accessibility. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The slightly rounded terminals and generous curves add a touch of warmth and approachability, balancing the geometric structure and preventing it from feeling overly rigid. This combination of playful geometry and approachable curves makes Folks a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from branding and packaging to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its retro-inspired aesthetic adds a touch of nostalgia and personality, while its strong legibility and versatility ensure it remains relevant in contemporary design contexts.",
