    "detailed_description": "Dologan is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with a touch of roundedness, creating a unique balance between modern clarity and approachable warmth. The font's distinctive feature is its bold, almost chunky weight, achieved through a combination of thick strokes and generous letterforms. This weight gives Dologan a strong presence, making it ideal for headlines and display applications. The rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in letters like 'a' and 'o', soften the geometric structure, adding a touch of playfulness and approachability. This combination of bold weight and rounded details creates a font that is both confident and inviting, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Dologan's bold presence evokes a sense of confidence and authority, while its rounded details suggest a friendly and approachable personality. This duality makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of strength and warmth.",
