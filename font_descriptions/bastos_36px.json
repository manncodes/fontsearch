    "detailed_description": "Font Bastos is a bold and playful display typeface that draws inspiration from both retrofuturistic design and the intricate details of circuit boards. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and rounded corners, creates a sense of futuristic energy, while the intricate details, like the small circles and lines that form the letterforms, add a layer of complexity and depth. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other display applications. The overall effect is a font that is both eye-catching and engaging, with a playful personality that evokes a sense of wonder and excitement. It's a font that feels both nostalgic and futuristic, referencing the technological optimism of the past while looking forward to the possibilities of the future.",
