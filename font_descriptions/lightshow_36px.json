    "detailed_description": "Lightshow PM is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct 3D extrusion effect. The letterforms are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a sense of solidity and structure. The extrusion adds a playful dimension, giving the font a dynamic and almost kinetic feel. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements, particularly in digital contexts where its 3D effect can be effectively rendered. The overall impression is one of confident energy and playful modernity, reminiscent of early 3D graphics and video game aesthetics. This makes it a compelling choice for projects seeking a retro-futuristic vibe or a touch of playful irreverence.",
