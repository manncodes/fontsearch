    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, geometric construction, evokes a sense of futuristic energy and digital precision. The sharp, angular terminals and consistent stroke widths create a clean, uncluttered aesthetic, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and the graphic design of the 1980s. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital displays and print applications. The font's bold, assertive character lends itself to headlines, branding, and technical documentation, conveying a sense of authority and innovation. Its strong, geometric forms and clean lines create a sense of order and structure, while the slightly rounded corners add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. The font's overall impression is one of confident modernity, suggesting a blend of technological advancement and human ingenuity.",
