    "detailed_description": "105 Beats That is a bold, sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost pixelated, aesthetic. Its construction is based on a geometric grid, evident in the sharp angles and consistent proportions of the letterforms. The typeface features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The most striking feature is the unique, jagged edge treatment applied to each letter, creating a sense of energy and dynamism. This treatment, reminiscent of early digital graphics and pixel art, adds a playful and almost rebellious character to the typeface. While the geometric foundation provides a sense of order and structure, the jagged edges inject a dose of unpredictability and visual interest. This combination makes 105 Beats That suitable for a range of applications, from bold headlines and branding elements to digital interfaces and graphic design projects. Its bold personality and contemporary aesthetic make it particularly well-suited for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of irreverence.",
