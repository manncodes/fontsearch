    "detailed_description": "Drankovic is a script font that embodies the raw energy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, gestural strokes and uneven letterforms create a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The font's construction is based on a loose, organic structure, with each letterform appearing as if it were drawn in a single, continuous motion. This results in a highly expressive and dynamic typeface, where the individual character of each letter is emphasized. The font's personality is both playful and rebellious, suggesting a sense of youthful energy and a disregard for traditional typographic conventions. It evokes a sense of street art and graffiti, with its rough edges and bold strokes. Drankovic is well-suited for projects that require a bold and expressive visual identity, such as branding for streetwear brands, music projects, or edgy graphic designs. Its informal and energetic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and short text blocks, where its unique character can shine. However, its irregular nature may make it less suitable for large blocks of text or applications requiring high legibility.",
