    "detailed_description": "College Boy is a bold, sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic American sports typography. Its geometric construction, with strong, vertical strokes and open counters, creates a sense of confident clarity. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of bold structure and subtle warmth makes College Boy suitable for a wide range of applications, from sports branding and headlines to editorial layouts and digital interfaces. Its nostalgic feel evokes a sense of Americana and classic athleticism, while its contemporary execution ensures it remains relevant in modern design contexts.",
