    "detailed_description": "Fat Max is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on sharp, angular shapes with a strong emphasis on verticality. The letterforms are tightly packed, with minimal spacing between characters, creating a dense and impactful visual presence. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to its legibility even at smaller sizes. The terminals are often cut off abruptly, adding to the font's assertive and slightly aggressive character. This combination of geometric precision and bold, almost brutalist aesthetics evokes a sense of power and authority, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi design and cyberpunk aesthetics. Fat Max is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold presence and retro-futuristic vibe make it ideal for projects that aim to convey a sense of innovation, technology, or power. However, its aggressive nature might not be suitable for all applications, particularly those requiring a more approachable or delicate tone.",
