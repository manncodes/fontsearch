    "detailed_description": "Ancillary is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Ancillary versatile, suitable for both digital interfaces and print applications. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for web content, mobile apps, and user interfaces. Its neutral character and lack of overt stylistic flourishes allow it to blend seamlessly into various design contexts, making it a reliable choice for branding, editorial design, and even signage. Ancillary's overall impression is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a brand that values clarity, accessibility, and a touch of understated elegance.",
