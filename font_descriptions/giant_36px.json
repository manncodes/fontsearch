    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, double-lined construction, reminiscent of early digital displays or retro video game graphics. Each letterform is composed of clean, geometric shapes with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight, creating a strong, almost mechanical aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the uniform stroke width contributes to a sense of order and clarity. The overall effect is one of confident simplicity, with a touch of retro charm. This font's bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and playful energy, making it suitable for projects that aim to capture a vintage or futuristic vibe. However, its simplicity and legibility also make it adaptable for more contemporary applications, particularly in digital interfaces and user experiences.",
