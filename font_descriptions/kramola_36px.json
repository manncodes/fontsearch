    "detailed_description": "Kramola is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost architectural character. Its construction is based on precise angles and straight lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are tightly spaced, with minimal variation in stroke weight, contributing to a sense of uniformity and consistency. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding a touch of boldness and assertiveness. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a hint of humanism, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives Kramola a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its strong legibility and bold presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a modern, confident, and slightly futuristic aesthetic is desired. The font's geometric nature evokes a sense of precision and order, while the subtle curves suggest a touch of warmth and approachability. This duality makes Kramola a versatile choice for projects that require a balance between technical sophistication and human connection.",
