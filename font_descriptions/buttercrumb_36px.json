    "detailed_description": "This font, with its strong geometric construction and sharp, angular terminals, embodies a classic, almost austere aesthetic. The consistent stroke weight and tight letter spacing create a sense of order and precision, reminiscent of early 20th-century sans-serif designs. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. While the overall impression is one of formality and authority, the subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. This balance between structure and humanity makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects, from corporate branding to editorial design, where a clear and confident voice is desired.",
