    "detailed_description": "Graysstroke is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in perfectly aligned, rectangular letterforms with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths. This geometric foundation gives the font a sense of order and clarity, making it highly legible even at small sizes. However, the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in letterform proportions add a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. The overall character of Graysstroke is confident and modern, yet with a nod to the graphic design trends of the mid-20th century. Its bold, assertive presence makes it suitable for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. While its geometric nature lends itself to technical applications, the subtle humanization ensures it remains approachable and engaging. Graysstroke evokes a sense of retrofuturism, suggesting a blend of classic design principles with a forward-thinking sensibility.",
