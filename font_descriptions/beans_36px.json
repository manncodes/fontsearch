    "detailed_description": "Beans is a display typeface that blends classic Western lettering with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional letterforms, featuring a strong vertical axis, pronounced serifs, and a generous x-height. The serifs are carefully crafted with subtle curves, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise bold and confident forms. The overall impression is one of classic elegance with a modern twist, making it suitable for a range of applications from branding and signage to editorial and web design. The font's bold presence and clear legibility make it ideal for headlines and titles, while its subtle details and playful character allow it to be used effectively in smaller sizes for body text and decorative elements. Beans evokes a sense of nostalgia and tradition, yet its clean lines and contemporary proportions make it feel fresh and relevant. It's a versatile typeface that can be used to create a range of moods, from sophisticated and refined to playful and whimsical.",
