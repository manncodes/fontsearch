    "detailed_description": "This font's design is rooted in a geometric construction, with each letterform fitting neatly within a square frame. The bold, black outlines create a strong visual presence, while the subtle beveling and metallic sheen add a touch of dimensionality. The overall effect is one of confident solidity, reminiscent of early computer interfaces or retro video game graphics. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The slightly rounded terminals and consistent stroke weights contribute to a sense of approachability, balancing the font's inherent boldness with a touch of warmth. This combination of technical precision and visual appeal makes it ideal for projects that require a retro-futuristic aesthetic, evoking a sense of playful nostalgia while maintaining a modern edge.",
