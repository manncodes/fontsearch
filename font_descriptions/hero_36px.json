    "detailed_description": "Hero is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a bold, geometric aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in clean, angular lines, with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical strokes. The letterforms are tightly spaced, creating a sense of density and power. The overall character is confident and assertive, with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. The font's sharp terminals and consistent weight distribution contribute to its strong legibility, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications. Its bold presence and geometric structure evoke a sense of authority and modernity, while its retro-inspired design hints at a playful, almost rebellious spirit. Hero's versatility allows it to be used in a wide range of contexts, from high-impact branding to digital interfaces, adding a touch of retro-futuristic flair to any project.",
