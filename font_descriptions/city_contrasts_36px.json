    "detailed_description": "City Contrasts is a display typeface that embodies a raw, energetic aesthetic. Its construction is characterized by bold, irregular strokes with pronounced serifs and a distinct grunge texture. This texture, achieved through the use of distressed edges and uneven line weights, gives the font a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The letterforms themselves are often asymmetrical, with exaggerated curves and sharp angles, contributing to the font's dynamic and rebellious character. While the overall design is bold and assertive, the font maintains a degree of legibility, particularly in its lowercase forms, which are more restrained and consistent. This balance allows for a range of applications, from eye-catching headlines to edgy branding and street-inspired designs. The font's raw energy and rebellious spirit evoke a sense of urban grit and underground culture, making it a powerful tool for conveying a message of authenticity and defiance.",
