    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, extruded 3D effect, achieved through a series of parallel strokes that create a sense of depth and volume. The geometric construction of the letterforms, with sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, contributes to a clean, almost pixelated aesthetic. This combination of 3D illusion and geometric precision evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of early video game graphics or 1980s sci-fi designs. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its playful and energetic personality makes it ideal for projects that require a sense of fun and dynamism, such as game interfaces, posters, or branding for tech-focused companies.",
