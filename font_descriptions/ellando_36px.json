    "detailed_description": "Ellando is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letters are built upon a grid system, evident in the consistent proportions and clean lines, particularly in the uppercase characters. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase letters, like the 'a' and 'g', introduce a touch of warmth and personality. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness creates a font that is both legible and visually engaging. Ellando's moderate x-height and open counters ensure readability even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The font's overall character is confident and contemporary, with a hint of playfulness that makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic evoke a sense of efficiency and innovation, while the subtle humanist touches add a touch of warmth and approachability. Ellando's versatility and contemporary appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and personality.",
