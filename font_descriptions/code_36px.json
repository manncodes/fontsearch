    "detailed_description": "Code is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its clean lines, open counters, and consistent stroke weights. The font's construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The lowercase letters are particularly notable for their distinctive forms, such as the rounded 'a' and the open 'e,' which add a touch of personality to the otherwise minimalist design. The overall effect is one of clarity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from digital interfaces to print materials. Code's minimalist aesthetic evokes a sense of modernity and functionality, aligning with contemporary design trends that prioritize simplicity and clarity. Its clean lines and geometric forms suggest a sense of order and precision, while the open counters and consistent stroke weights ensure readability even at small sizes. This makes it an ideal choice for projects that require a clean, modern, and easily digestible visual language.",
