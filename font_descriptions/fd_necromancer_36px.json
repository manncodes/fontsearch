    "detailed_description": "The font's defining characteristic is its bold, isometric construction, giving it a distinctly three-dimensional appearance. Each letterform is built from a series of angled planes, creating a sense of depth and solidity. This geometric approach lends a sense of order and precision, while the sharp angles and strong contrasts contribute to a powerful and assertive personality. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold presence and geometric structure evoke a sense of futuristic technology, reminiscent of early video game graphics or cyberpunk aesthetics. This makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual impact and a sense of technological innovation, such as game design, branding for tech companies, or futuristic-themed projects.",
