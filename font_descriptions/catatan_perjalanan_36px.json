    "detailed_description": "Catatan Perjalanan is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten notes. Its organic forms, characterized by uneven strokes and expressive curves, evoke a sense of spontaneity and personal connection. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure readability, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. The slightly irregular baseline adds to its hand-drawn charm, while the consistent weight and well-defined terminals contribute to its overall legibility. This font's personality is both approachable and energetic, suggesting a sense of warmth and authenticity. It's reminiscent of handwritten notes, personal journals, and informal communications, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of human touch and a sense of casual charm. Its versatility allows it to be used in a variety of applications, from branding and packaging to social media graphics and website design. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to the act of writing, evoking a sense of personal expression and creative freedom.",
