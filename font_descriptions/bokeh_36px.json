    "detailed_description": "Bokeh is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of playfulness. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost robotic, curves and angles of its letterforms. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The terminals, while primarily geometric, exhibit a slight rounding, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the overall design. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Bokeh a unique character, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and modern feel make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, while its playful nature allows it to be used effectively in projects that require a touch of personality. Bokeh's overall impression is one of confidence and clarity, suggesting a brand or message that is both modern and approachable.",
