    "detailed_description": "Epilog is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. Its construction is based on clean, precise lines and angles, giving it a strong, confident presence. However, the rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing it from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to body text and digital interfaces. Epilog's bold, confident character evokes a sense of professionalism and modernity, while its subtle humanist details make it feel approachable and inviting. This balance makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence without sacrificing readability or warmth.",
