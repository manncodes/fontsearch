    "detailed_description": "Jombo Hands is a playful, hand-drawn font that captures the energy of childhood scribbles. Its irregular letterforms, with their uneven strokes and rounded terminals, evoke a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text. While the overall construction is loose and organic, there's a deliberate consistency in the weight and flow of the strokes, suggesting a controlled hand behind the apparent randomness. This balance between playful informality and underlying structure gives Jombo Hands a unique charm, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality. Its casual yet legible nature makes it perfect for children's books, playful branding, or adding a touch of fun to digital interfaces.",
