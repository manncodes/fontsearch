    "detailed_description": "Carme is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail makes Carme versatile, suitable for both digital interfaces and print applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for body text and web content. The overall impression is one of confident simplicity, suggesting a brand that values clarity, accessibility, and a touch of personality. Carme's clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of innovation and progress, making it a fitting choice for technology companies, startups, and brands seeking a contemporary and approachable identity.",
