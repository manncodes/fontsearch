    "detailed_description": "Lipstick Traces is a display typeface that captures the raw energy of handwritten script. Its irregular, gestural strokes and uneven letterforms evoke the immediacy of a quick scribble, creating a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The font's rough edges and textured lines, reminiscent of a lipstick mark, add a touch of grit and rebellion. While its legibility is limited due to the inconsistent letterforms and lack of consistent baseline, it excels in conveying a sense of personality and attitude. Its bold, expressive nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. The font's raw, unpolished aesthetic aligns with contemporary trends in design, where authenticity and imperfection are valued. It evokes a sense of rebellion and individuality, reflecting a cultural shift towards self-expression and non-conformity.",
