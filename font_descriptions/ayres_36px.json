    "detailed_description": "Ayres is a serif typeface that blends classic proportions with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional serif anatomy, with clear distinctions between thick and thin strokes, well-defined serifs, and a consistent baseline. The x-height is moderate, contributing to a balanced and legible appearance. The overall character is refined and elegant, yet it avoids being overly formal. The slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling cold or sterile. This balance makes Ayres suitable for a wide range of applications, from editorial design and branding to web interfaces and mobile apps. Its classic yet approachable personality makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of sophistication without sacrificing readability. The font's subtle humanist details and overall refined aesthetic evoke a sense of timeless elegance, while its contemporary proportions and clean execution ensure its relevance in modern design contexts.",
