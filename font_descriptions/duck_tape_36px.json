    "detailed_description": "Duck Tape 36px is a display typeface that embodies a raw, DIY aesthetic. Its chunky, geometric letterforms are built with a distinct lack of refinement, featuring jagged edges, uneven strokes, and a rough, textured surface. This deliberate imperfection gives the font a sense of immediacy and authenticity, as if it were hand-drawn with a marker or cut out from duct tape. The font's bold, uppercase-only design conveys a sense of strength and informality, making it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While its rough edges might limit its legibility in extended text, Duck Tape 36px excels in short bursts, adding a touch of grit and personality to any design. Its cultural associations range from punk rock aesthetics to the DIY spirit of street art, making it a perfect choice for projects that embrace a rebellious and unconventional approach.",
