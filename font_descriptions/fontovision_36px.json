    "detailed_description": "Fontvision is a bold, condensed sans-serif typeface that exudes a dynamic energy. Its geometric construction, with sharp angles and strong verticality, creates a sense of speed and power. The extreme slant, exceeding 15 degrees, adds to this dynamic feel, while the high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and condensed proportions give it a commanding presence, making it ideal for headlines and branding elements that demand attention. Its sharp terminals and angular forms evoke a sense of modernity and edge, aligning it with contemporary design trends. The overall impression is one of confident assertiveness, suggesting a brand that is bold, innovative, and forward-thinking.",
