    "detailed_description": "This cuneiform script, a foundational writing system of ancient Mesopotamia, is characterized by its distinctive wedge-shaped marks, known as 'cuneiform' signs. Each sign represents a syllable or a word, and their arrangement forms a complex system of writing. The signs are created by pressing a wedge-shaped stylus into clay tablets, resulting in a unique visual texture. The script's angularity and geometric precision convey a sense of order and structure, reflecting the ancient Mesopotamian civilization's emphasis on mathematics, astronomy, and record-keeping. The script's historical significance is undeniable, as it served as the primary means of communication for over 3,000 years, documenting laws, literature, and everyday life. While its practical use is limited today, its enduring presence in museums and archaeological sites continues to fascinate and inspire, reminding us of the power of writing to preserve knowledge and shape civilizations.",
