    "detailed_description": "This font's geometric construction is immediately apparent, with its sharp angles and consistent stroke widths. The letterforms are built from a series of straight lines and right angles, creating a clean and modern aesthetic. The overall impression is one of precision and efficiency, reminiscent of digital displays and early computer interfaces. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The slightly rounded terminals, however, add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes it versatile for a range of projects, from tech-focused branding to contemporary editorial design. The font's inherent digital aesthetic evokes a sense of innovation and progress, while its clean lines and strong legibility suggest reliability and clarity.",
