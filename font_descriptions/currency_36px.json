    "detailed_description": "Currency is a bold sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong verticality and consistent stroke weights create a sense of stability and authority, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of clarity and warmth makes Currency suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold presence evokes a sense of confidence and modernity, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile or aggressive. Currency's versatility and timeless appeal make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
