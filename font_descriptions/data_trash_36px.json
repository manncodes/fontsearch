    "detailed_description": "Data Trash is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are built with a strong emphasis on verticality, with a high x-height and open counters that contribute to its bold and assertive character. The font's distinctive features include its squared terminals, which add a touch of retro-futuristic flair, and its slightly condensed letterforms, which create a sense of dynamism and energy. The overall effect is a font that is both confident and playful, capable of conveying a sense of power and authority while remaining approachable and engaging. Data Trash is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly in situations where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold and assertive nature makes it ideal for conveying messages of strength, innovation, and disruption, while its playful elements add a touch of personality and approachability. The font's cultural resonance lies in its connection to both the retro-futuristic aesthetic of the 1980s and the contemporary trend of bold, geometric design. It evokes a sense of nostalgia for a time of technological advancement and optimism, while also feeling fresh and relevant in today's digital landscape.",
