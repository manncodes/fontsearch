    "detailed_description": "Lebowski is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost architectural character. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The terminals are cut at sharp angles, adding to the overall sense of precision and modernity. While the geometric foundation gives Lebowski a clean, almost austere feel, the subtle variations in stroke weight and the slight rounding of some corners inject a touch of humanity, preventing it from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes Lebowski versatile, suitable for both bold headlines and more extended text blocks. Its strong presence and contemporary aesthetic make it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces, particularly in contexts that demand a sense of confidence and authority.",
