    "detailed_description": "Chitoso is a bold, sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its strong, upright strokes and consistent weight create a sense of solidity and confidence, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is a typeface that feels both modern and timeless, capable of conveying a sense of authority and trustworthiness without being overly formal. Its bold weight and confident character make it suitable for headlines, branding, and display applications, while its legibility and versatility allow it to be used effectively in body text and digital interfaces. Chitoso's design evokes a sense of mid-century optimism, with its clean lines and bold forms reminiscent of the era's architectural and graphic design trends. However, its contemporary feel and digital-native aesthetic make it equally relevant for modern projects.",
