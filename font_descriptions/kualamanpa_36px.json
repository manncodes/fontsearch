    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a classic serif construction with a strong emphasis on verticality. The letterforms are tall and narrow, with a high x-height and a pronounced contrast between thick and thin strokes. The serifs are delicate and slightly bracketed, adding a touch of elegance to the overall design. The overall character is refined and sophisticated, suggesting a sense of tradition and authority. The font's historical influences are evident in its resemblance to classic serif styles, particularly those from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the font's contemporary relevance is undeniable, as its clean lines and strong legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from print to digital media. The font's cultural associations are rooted in its historical context, evoking a sense of timeless elegance and sophistication. It can be seen as a modern interpretation of classic typography, balancing tradition with contemporary sensibilities.",
