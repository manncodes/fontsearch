    "detailed_description": "Ethnocentric is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a sense of speed and dynamism. Its construction is based on sharp angles and strong, consistent strokes, creating a sense of precision and power. The letters are designed with a distinct slant, adding a dynamic element to the overall composition. This slant, combined with the open counters and high x-height, ensures excellent legibility even at smaller sizes. The font's bold character is further emphasized by the use of sharp terminals and a consistent weight throughout the alphabet. This creates a sense of confidence and authority, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Ethnocentric's design evokes a sense of futuristic technology and urban energy, reminiscent of cyberpunk aesthetics and the visual language of science fiction. Its bold, angular forms and dynamic slant suggest movement and progress, making it a compelling choice for projects that aim to convey a sense of innovation and forward momentum.",
