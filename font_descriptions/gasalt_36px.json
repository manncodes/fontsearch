    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a clean, geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. The letterforms are composed of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of precision and order. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric rigor and humanist detail gives the font a contemporary feel, while still maintaining a sense of classic elegance. The font's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and web typography. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying professionalism and clarity, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly cold or sterile. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modern sophistication, suggesting a brand or product that is both innovative and timeless.",
