    "detailed_description": "Gaboed is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric design principles. Its construction is characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a strong emphasis on geometric shapes, particularly in the lowercase letters. The letterforms are generally open and airy, with a high x-height that contributes to its legibility. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of warmth and approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Gaboed a distinct personality, making it feel both contemporary and timeless. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it well-suited for a variety of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and professionalism, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a modern and sophisticated aesthetic.",
