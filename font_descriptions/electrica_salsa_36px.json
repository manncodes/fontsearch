    "detailed_description": "Electric Salsa is a display font that embodies a playful, energetic spirit through its unique construction. Each letterform is built from a series of jagged, zig-zagging lines, creating a visually dynamic and somewhat chaotic aesthetic. This irregular construction, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, gives the font a sense of spontaneity and immediacy. The font's overall character is bold and attention-grabbing, with a strong sense of movement and energy. It evokes a sense of fun and excitement, reminiscent of vintage arcade games or 80s pop culture. While the jagged lines might seem unconventional, they are carefully crafted to ensure legibility, particularly at larger sizes. The font's bold strokes and open counters contribute to its readability, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where visual impact is paramount. However, its irregular nature might limit its use in extended text blocks, especially at smaller sizes. Electric Salsa's unique character and playful energy make it a perfect choice for projects that require a bold, attention-grabbing visual style, particularly those with a retro or pop culture theme.",
