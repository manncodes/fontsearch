    "detailed_description": "Bastardus Sans embodies a clean, functional aesthetic rooted in geometric construction principles. Its letterforms are characterized by a consistent stroke weight and a lack of extraneous embellishments, resulting in a straightforward and legible typeface. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its readability, particularly at smaller sizes. While the overall design is geometric, subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals, inject a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance creates a typeface that feels both modern and timeless. Bastardus Sans is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for conveying professionalism and clarity, while its subtle warmth ensures that it doesn't feel overly sterile or cold. The font's versatility and timeless appeal make it a valuable tool for designers seeking a typeface that can adapt to a variety of contexts.",
