    "detailed_description": "Antler Caps is a bold and playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten lettering. Its irregular, gestural strokes and exaggerated letterforms create a sense of immediacy and personality. The font's construction is based on a loose, organic structure, with varying stroke weights and angles that contribute to its dynamic character. The high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's overall mood is energetic and expressive, suggesting a sense of fun and informality. It evokes a sense of vintage Americana, reminiscent of hand-painted signs and vintage advertising. Antler Caps is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of whimsy. Its casual yet confident style makes it ideal for projects targeting a younger audience or those seeking a unique and memorable visual identity.",
