    "detailed_description": "Degrading Morals is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric construction with a subtle grunge aesthetic. The letters are built on a grid system, resulting in a clean and consistent structure. However, the addition of distressed edges and textured outlines gives the font a raw and edgy feel. This combination of order and chaos creates a unique personality, balancing a sense of authority with a touch of rebellion. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale headlines and smaller body text. The distressed edges add a layer of visual interest, particularly when used in digital applications where the texture can be amplified. The font's overall character evokes a sense of grit and authenticity, suggesting a brand that is both confident and unafraid to push boundaries. It's a versatile typeface that can be used to create a range of moods, from edgy and rebellious to sophisticated and modern.",
