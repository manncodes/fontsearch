    "detailed_description": "Blueberry Foxhound is a display typeface characterized by its bold, playful forms and exaggerated proportions. Each letter is constructed with a series of sharp angles and rounded curves, creating a dynamic and energetic visual impact. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes. The exaggerated ascenders and descenders add to the font's playful personality, while the overall weight and bold strokes give it a confident and assertive presence. The font's design evokes a sense of fun and whimsy, reminiscent of classic cartoon characters and vintage comic book lettering. Its bold and playful nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its exaggerated proportions and bold weight may limit its use in body text or smaller sizes.",
