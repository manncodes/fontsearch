    "detailed_description": "Enfatica is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built upon a strong, consistent grid, with clean lines and sharp corners that give the font a sense of clarity and precision. However, the slight rounding of the terminals and the subtle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric structure and humanist details creates a font that is both legible and visually engaging, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Enfatica's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, while its bold weight and confident slant give it a sense of dynamism and energy. The font's contemporary aesthetic and versatility make it well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, particularly in contexts that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
