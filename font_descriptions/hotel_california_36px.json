    "detailed_description": "Hotel California is a display typeface that embodies a playful retro aesthetic with a touch of modern edge. Its defining characteristic is the double-outline construction, creating a bold, almost three-dimensional effect. The outlines are not perfectly parallel, adding a subtle hand-drawn quality that softens the geometric structure. The letterforms themselves are based on a classic sans-serif design, with rounded terminals and a consistent x-height, ensuring good legibility even at smaller sizes. This combination of retro-inspired design and modern execution gives Hotel California a unique personality, balancing nostalgia with a contemporary feel. The font's playful nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a touch of whimsy and personality. Its bold presence and clear legibility also make it suitable for signage and display applications, particularly in digital environments where its retro charm can stand out. The overall effect is a font that evokes a sense of fun and nostalgia, reminiscent of vintage signage and playful graphics, while still feeling fresh and relevant in today's digital landscape.",
