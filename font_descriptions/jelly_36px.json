    "detailed_description": "Jelly is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a playful yet confident spirit. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, provides a sense of order and clarity. The rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in letters like 'a' and 'c', soften the geometric rigidity, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between structure and softness creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and inviting. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and branding to website interfaces and mobile apps. Jelly's bold and playful personality, reminiscent of 1950s and 1960s graphic design, evokes a sense of optimism and fun, making it ideal for projects that require a touch of retro charm. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to bridge the gap between classic design principles and modern digital aesthetics, offering a fresh and engaging visual experience.",
