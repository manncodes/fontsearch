    "detailed_description": "Darjeeling is a playful script font that blends a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a touch of vintage charm. Its flowing strokes and rounded forms create a sense of warmth and approachability, while the subtle variations in letterforms add a touch of personality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a variety of applications. The overall effect is one of lightheartedness and whimsy, reminiscent of handwritten notes or vintage signage. While its casual nature makes it ideal for informal projects, its well-defined forms and consistent stroke weights also lend it a degree of professionalism, making it suitable for branding, packaging, and even editorial design. Darjeeling's playful personality and versatility make it a charming choice for projects that seek to evoke a sense of warmth, nostalgia, and approachability.",
