    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, three-dimensional appearance, achieved through a series of parallel strokes that create a sense of depth and movement. The letterforms are constructed with a geometric precision, evident in the consistent angles and sharp terminals. This geometric foundation lends a sense of order and structure, while the exaggerated depth adds a dynamic, almost kinetic energy. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The overall effect is a playful yet sophisticated aesthetic, reminiscent of retrofuturistic design trends from the 1960s and 1970s. This font would be particularly effective in branding for technology companies, gaming studios, or any project seeking a bold, energetic, and slightly nostalgic feel.",
