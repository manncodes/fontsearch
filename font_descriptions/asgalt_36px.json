    "detailed_description": "Asgalt is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of humanist warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural proportions of the letterforms, particularly in the uppercase characters. The terminals, however, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall impression. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a typeface that feels both contemporary and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website copy to branding materials. The font's overall character is one of clarity and confidence, suggesting professionalism and a focus on communication. Its clean lines and neutral tone make it a versatile choice for a variety of projects, while the subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold.",
