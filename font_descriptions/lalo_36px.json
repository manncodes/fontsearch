    "detailed_description": "Lalo is a handwritten script font that captures the casual charm of personal note-taking. Its flowing strokes and irregular letterforms evoke the spontaneity of penmanship, creating a sense of warmth and authenticity. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. While the overall impression is relaxed and friendly, Lalo's carefully crafted letterforms and consistent stroke weights suggest a level of intentionality, preventing it from appearing overly childish or messy. This balance makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality without sacrificing professionalism, such as branding for small businesses, social media graphics, or handwritten-style invitations.",
