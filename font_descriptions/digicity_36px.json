    "detailed_description": "Digicity is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanist details gives Digicity a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and contemporary feel make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, while its strong legibility ensures its effectiveness in both print and online environments. Digicity's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and modernity, reflecting the values of contemporary digital culture.",
