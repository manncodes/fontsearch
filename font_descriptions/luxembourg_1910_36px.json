    "detailed_description": "Luxembourg 1910 is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct 3D effect. Its construction is based on clean, angular lines, creating a strong and confident presence. The letters are designed with a consistent stroke weight, resulting in a balanced and legible appearance. The 3D effect is achieved through a subtle shadow that adds depth and dimension to the characters, giving them a sense of solidity and weight. This effect is particularly noticeable in the uppercase letters, where the shadow creates a subtle beveling effect. The lowercase letters, while maintaining the geometric structure, are slightly more rounded, adding a touch of approachability to the overall design. The font's bold and confident character makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its geometric construction and clean lines lend themselves well to digital interfaces, while the 3D effect adds a touch of visual interest and sophistication. The font's historical inspiration, referencing early 20th-century design trends, adds a layer of sophistication and timeless appeal. It evokes a sense of industrial strength and modernism, making it suitable for projects that require a bold and confident aesthetic.",
