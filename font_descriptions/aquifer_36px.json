    "detailed_description": "Aquifer is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. Its construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights, giving it a sense of order and clarity. However, the rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on the lowercase letters introduce a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. The overall effect is a font that feels confident and professional without being overly formal, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications. Its contemporary aesthetic suggests a connection to digital design, while its subtle humanist touches evoke a sense of approachability and warmth, making it suitable for both corporate branding and user interfaces.",
