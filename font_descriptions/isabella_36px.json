    "detailed_description": "Isabella is a playful and expressive font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its irregular letterforms, with their rounded corners and uneven strokes, evoke a sense of spontaneity and informality. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of warmth and approachability, making it suitable for projects that require a friendly and engaging tone. While the font's casual nature might not be appropriate for formal documents, it excels in digital contexts, particularly for social media graphics, website headers, and playful branding. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of authenticity and personal connection, making it ideal for projects that aim to communicate a sense of warmth and approachability.",
