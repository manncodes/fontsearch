    "detailed_description": "Font Banding Pride 36px by Harder Type Foundry is a bold, italic display typeface with a strong geometric foundation. Its construction is characterized by sharp angles and a consistent stroke width, creating a sense of power and dynamism. The italic angle is pronounced, adding a sense of speed and movement. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at large sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of retro flair. It evokes the energy and excitement of vintage sports graphics and branding, while also feeling contemporary and adaptable. The font's bold presence and dynamic slant make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro aesthetic also lends itself well to projects with a vintage or nostalgic theme. While the font's bold nature makes it suitable for large-scale applications, it can also be used effectively in smaller sizes for branding elements or short bursts of text.",
