    "detailed_description": "Hardman is a bold, sans-serif typeface with a distinct geometric construction and a strong, confident personality. Its sharp angles and bold strokes create a sense of power and authority, while the slight slant adds a touch of dynamism. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall design is clean and modern, with a slight retro feel reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics. This combination of boldness and legibility makes Hardman ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its retro-futuristic vibe adds a layer of intrigue and personality, making it suitable for projects that aim to evoke a sense of innovation and progress.",
