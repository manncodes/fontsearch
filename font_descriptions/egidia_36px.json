    "detailed_description": "Egidia is a bold sans-serif typeface that embodies a classic, almost vintage aesthetic. Its construction is geometric, with clean lines and sharp corners, reminiscent of early 20th-century design. The letters are built with a strong, consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of solidity and confidence. The distinctive feature of Egidia is its double outline, which adds a layer of depth and dimension to the letters, making them appear both bold and refined. This outline also creates a subtle sense of movement, as if the letters are slightly raised from the surface. The overall character of Egidia is confident and authoritative, yet approachable and friendly. It evokes a sense of nostalgia, perhaps recalling vintage signage or classic branding. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from headlines and logos to editorial design and packaging. While its bold nature makes it ideal for large-scale displays, its clean lines and strong legibility ensure it remains effective even at smaller sizes. Egidia's vintage charm and contemporary relevance make it a versatile choice for projects seeking a timeless yet modern feel.",
