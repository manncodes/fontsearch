    "detailed_description": "A-Rang is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost rebellious spirit. Its construction is based on a bold, hand-drawn aesthetic, with each letterform exhibiting a distinct, almost chaotic energy. The strokes are thick and uneven, with sharp, jagged edges that create a sense of immediacy and raw expression. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to a sense of openness and legibility, even in its bold, expressive form. The overall character of the font is energetic and dynamic, suggesting a sense of movement and spontaneity. It evokes a sense of youthful rebellion, reminiscent of graffiti or street art, yet with a touch of whimsy that prevents it from feeling overly aggressive. A-Rang is best suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold, attention-grabbing statement is desired. Its unique character and playful energy make it ideal for projects that require a touch of irreverence and a strong visual impact.",
