    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a stark, minimalist aesthetic, built upon a grid-based structure with a strong emphasis on geometric shapes. The letterforms are composed of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of precision and clarity. The consistent stroke weight and lack of embellishments contribute to a clean, uncluttered appearance. While the overall impression is one of austerity, the font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes. The font's starkness evokes a sense of modernity and efficiency, suggesting a digital-native design sensibility. It would be well-suited for applications requiring a clean, uncluttered visual language, such as user interfaces, branding for technology companies, or minimalist graphic design projects.",
