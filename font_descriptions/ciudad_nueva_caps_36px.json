    "detailed_description": "Ciudad Nueva Caps is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1970s and 1980s. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and sharp corners. The letterforms are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability to the otherwise rigid structure. This combination of geometric precision and subtle humanization gives the font a confident yet friendly personality. Ciudad Nueva Caps is well-suited for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual presence is desired. Its retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and optimism, while its clean lines and modern construction make it relevant for contemporary design projects. The font's bold character and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale applications, such as signage, posters, and web banners. Its retro aesthetic also lends itself to projects that seek to evoke a sense of vintage style or to create a playful and energetic mood.",
