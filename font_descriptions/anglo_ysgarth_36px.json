    "detailed_description": "Buglo Ysgarth is a bold, italic typeface that blends classic gothic influences with a modern sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional gothic forms, featuring sharp angles, strong strokes, and a distinct contrast between thick and thin lines. However, the design incorporates subtle humanist details, such as slightly rounded terminals and a more open counter structure, which softens the overall impression. This balance creates a typeface that is both visually striking and surprisingly legible, even at smaller sizes. The italic angle is pronounced, adding a sense of dynamism and energy to the design. While the font's gothic heritage evokes a sense of history and tradition, its modern refinements make it suitable for contemporary applications, particularly in digital environments. Its bold presence and strong character make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and other applications where a powerful visual impact is desired.",
