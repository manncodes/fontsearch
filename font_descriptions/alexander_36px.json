    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, blocky forms and exaggerated 3D extrusion, is a playful and attention-grabbing display typeface. The geometric construction of the letters, with their sharp corners and consistent widths, creates a sense of solidity and strength. The exaggerated depth of the extrusion adds a dynamic element, giving the letters a sense of movement and energy. The overall effect is one of playful confidence, reminiscent of vintage video game graphics or retro sci-fi aesthetics. While the font's bold nature makes it ideal for headlines and branding elements, its legibility is somewhat compromised at smaller sizes due to the thick strokes and complex shapes. However, its unique character and retro charm make it a compelling choice for projects seeking a bold and playful visual identity.",
