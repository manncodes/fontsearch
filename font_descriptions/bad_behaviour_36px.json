    "detailed_description": "Bad Behaviour is a display typeface that embraces a playful, almost chaotic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a geometric framework, with each letterform built from a series of sharp, angular strokes. These strokes are then overlaid with a series of jagged, seemingly random lines, creating a sense of erosion or distortion. This layering adds a dynamic, almost kinetic energy to the typeface, making it feel both bold and slightly unpredictable. The high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the exaggerated serifs and sharp terminals contribute to its bold, almost aggressive character. Bad Behaviour is a font that demands attention, making it ideal for headlines, posters, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its playful, almost rebellious nature makes it particularly well-suited for projects that aim to capture a sense of youthful energy or subcultural rebellion. However, its bold, angular forms and chaotic aesthetic may not be suitable for all applications, particularly those requiring a more refined or formal tone.",
