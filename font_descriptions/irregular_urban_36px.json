    "detailed_description": "This font's bold, geometric construction is immediately striking, with a strong diagonal slant that adds a dynamic energy. The letterforms are built with sharp angles and clean lines, creating a sense of angularity and precision. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall effect is one of confident assertiveness, with a touch of retro-futuristic flair. The font's bold character and strong presence make it ideal for headlines, branding, and display applications, particularly in contexts where a sense of power and dynamism is desired. Its retro-inspired aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s, while its clean lines and sharp angles feel contemporary and impactful.",
