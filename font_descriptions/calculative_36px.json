    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with its letterforms constructed from precise angles and curves. The consistent stroke weight and sharp terminals contribute to a clean, modern aesthetic. The overall proportions are balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's design personality is characterized by its confident and assertive nature, conveying a sense of professionalism and authority. It draws inspiration from the geometric sans-serif styles of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary edge that feels both timeless and relevant. The font's cultural associations lean towards modernism and minimalism, suggesting a clean and efficient approach to design. Its practical applications are diverse, ranging from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's strong legibility and clean lines make it suitable for both large-scale displays and small-scale text, while its neutral character allows it to blend seamlessly with various design styles. The font evokes a sense of clarity and precision, resonating with audiences seeking a modern and sophisticated aesthetic. Its geometric construction and balanced proportions create a sense of order and control, while the sharp terminals add a touch of sharpness and focus.",
