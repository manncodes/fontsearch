    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, angular forms and sharp edges, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric construction is evident in the consistent use of straight lines and sharp angles, creating a sense of precision and order. The letters are designed with a strong emphasis on verticality, with a high x-height and a narrow overall width, contributing to a sense of power and dominance. The bold weight and sharp terminals further enhance this impression, while the slight slant adds a dynamic element, suggesting movement and energy. This font evokes a sense of the 1980s, reminiscent of arcade games and cyberpunk aesthetics, yet it retains a timeless quality that feels both nostalgic and futuristic. Its bold, assertive character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact, particularly in the gaming, technology, and entertainment industries. However, its sharp angles and narrow proportions might limit its legibility in smaller sizes or extended text blocks.",
