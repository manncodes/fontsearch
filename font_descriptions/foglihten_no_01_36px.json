    "detailed_description": "Foglihten No 01 exhibits a classic, yet subtly modern, sans-serif aesthetic. Its construction is rooted in geometric principles, evident in the clean, unornamented forms and consistent stroke weights. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a moderate x-height and open counters that ensure legibility even at smaller sizes. The terminals, while primarily geometric, feature a slight rounding that softens the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism creates a font that feels both professional and inviting. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its well-designed punctuation and numeral set, which seamlessly integrate with the letterforms. Foglihten No 01's clean lines and balanced proportions make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its timeless elegance and subtle modernity evoke a sense of sophistication and clarity, making it a strong choice for projects that require a clean, contemporary aesthetic.",
