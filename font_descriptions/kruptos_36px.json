    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a distinct geometric construction, with sharp angles and precise lines defining its letterforms. The overall structure is highly symmetrical, creating a sense of order and clarity. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The terminals are often squared off, adding to the font's clean and modern aesthetic. While the geometric foundation provides a sense of rigidity, the font avoids feeling overly cold or sterile. Subtle variations in stroke weight and the occasional rounded corner introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between structure and softness makes the font versatile, suitable for both technical applications and more creative projects. The font's clean lines and bold presence evoke a sense of confidence and authority, making it ideal for branding, headlines, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its contemporary feel suggests a connection to digital culture, while its underlying geometric structure hints at a timeless quality.",
