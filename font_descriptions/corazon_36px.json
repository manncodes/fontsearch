    "detailed_description": "Corazon is a display typeface that blends a retro-inspired aesthetic with a contemporary edge. Its construction is based on a geometric framework, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths of the uppercase letters. However, the font's personality is softened by the inclusion of subtly rounded terminals and a slightly condensed letterform structure. This balance creates a visual tension that feels both playful and sophisticated. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and branding elements. Its bold, confident character evokes a sense of retrofuturism, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi aesthetics, while its clean lines and modern proportions feel distinctly contemporary. Corazon's unique blend of retro charm and digital edge makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a strong visual impact and a touch of playful personality.",
