    "detailed_description": "Filipi is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are carefully balanced, with a high x-height that ensures strong legibility even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Filipi versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and innovation, while its subtle warmth suggests approachability and trustworthiness. Filipi's versatility makes it suitable for both print and digital media, and its clean lines ensure excellent legibility across various sizes and resolutions.",
