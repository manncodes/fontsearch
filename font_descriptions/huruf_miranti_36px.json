    "detailed_description": "Huruf Miranti is a playful script font that blends classic calligraphic influences with a contemporary, almost cartoonish energy. The letters are characterized by their generous curves, flowing strokes, and a distinct lack of serifs. This combination creates a sense of movement and whimsy, while the overall structure remains legible and balanced. The font's generous x-height and open counters contribute to its readability, even at smaller sizes. The slightly exaggerated curves and playful swashes add a touch of personality, making it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and playful digital content. The font's overall character evokes a sense of fun and approachability, reminiscent of vintage signage and hand-drawn lettering. It's a versatile choice for projects that require a touch of personality and a hint of nostalgia.",
