    "detailed_description": "Brea is a sans-serif typeface that combines a geometric construction with a subtle humanist touch. Its clean lines and consistent stroke weights create a sense of order and clarity, while the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. Brea's overall character is confident and modern, yet approachable and friendly. It draws inspiration from classic geometric sans-serif designs, but with a contemporary twist that feels both timeless and fresh. Brea's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to web and mobile interfaces. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for large-scale displays, while its subtle humanist details add a touch of personality to smaller text. Brea's contemporary aesthetic and balanced personality make it a strong choice for projects that require a clean, modern look with a touch of warmth and approachability.",
