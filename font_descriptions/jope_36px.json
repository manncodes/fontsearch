    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and playful display typeface that draws inspiration from both vintage signage and contemporary street art. Its chunky, irregular letterforms are built with a combination of geometric and organic shapes, creating a dynamic and energetic visual impact. The letters are heavily stylized, with exaggerated curves, sharp angles, and uneven strokes that give the font a raw and hand-drawn feel. The overall effect is one of bold, expressive energy, making it ideal for grabbing attention in headlines, posters, and other graphic applications. While its legibility is best at larger sizes, the font's unique character and playful energy make it a strong choice for adding a touch of irreverence and personality to any design project.",
