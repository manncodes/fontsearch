    "detailed_description": "Alex Toth (36px) is a display font that captures the energy and informality of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular, slightly wobbly strokes evoke the immediacy of a quick sketch, while the bold weight and generous x-height ensure strong legibility even at large sizes. The font's playful personality is further emphasized by the exaggerated curves and rounded terminals, which add a touch of whimsy to its overall character. While the font's construction is inherently loose, it maintains a sense of balance through consistent stroke weights and a clear, legible structure. This makes it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold, expressive statement is desired. The font's cultural associations lean towards a retro-inspired aesthetic, reminiscent of vintage comic book lettering or hand-drawn signage. Its playful energy and bold presence make it a perfect choice for projects that seek to evoke a sense of nostalgia or playful irreverence.",
