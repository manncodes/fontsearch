    "detailed_description": "Johnny Fever is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from the graphic design of the 1980s. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent proportions. The font features a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the font's assertive and confident character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and subtle organic elements gives Johnny Fever a unique personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold presence and retro aesthetic make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces that require a strong visual impact. The font's cultural associations with 80s pop culture and retro gaming evoke a sense of nostalgia and playful energy, making it a compelling choice for projects seeking a distinctive and engaging visual identity.",
