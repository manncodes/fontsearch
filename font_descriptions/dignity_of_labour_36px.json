    "detailed_description": "Dignity of Labour is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct, almost mechanical aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in sharp, angular letterforms with consistent stroke widths. The typeface features a high x-height and open counters, contributing to its strong legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are squared off, adding to the overall sense of precision and rigidity. While the font's geometric nature suggests a sense of order and efficiency, the subtle variations in letterform construction, such as the rounded corners on the 'a' and 'e', introduce a touch of humanity and prevent the typeface from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization makes Dignity of Labour suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and digital signage. Its bold, confident character evokes a sense of strength and reliability, making it ideal for projects that require a modern, yet timeless aesthetic. The font's geometric construction and sharp lines also suggest a connection to the digital world, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a contemporary feel.",
