    "detailed_description": "This font, with its double-lined construction, embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. The geometric shapes, particularly evident in the uppercase letters, are crisp and angular, reminiscent of early digital displays or even the bold lines of 1980s arcade games. The consistent stroke width and sharp terminals contribute to a sense of clarity and precision, while the slight rounding of the corners softens the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly harsh or cold. This balance between geometric rigor and subtle humanization makes the font versatile, suitable for both bold headlines and more extended text, particularly in digital contexts where its clean lines and strong legibility shine. The font's overall character evokes a sense of playful confidence, suggesting a brand or project that is both innovative and approachable.",
