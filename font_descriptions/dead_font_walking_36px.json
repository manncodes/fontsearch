    "detailed_description": "Dead Font Walking is a bold, expressive typeface that draws inspiration from the rough-hewn aesthetic of hand-painted signage and urban graffiti. Its chunky, irregular letterforms are characterized by exaggerated strokes, jagged edges, and a distinct lack of uniformity. This deliberate imperfection creates a sense of raw energy and immediacy, reminiscent of street art and DIY culture. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for headlines, posters, and other display applications. Its bold, assertive character makes it ideal for conveying a message of rebellion, authenticity, or street-level grit. While its rough edges might not be suitable for extended body text, Dead Font Walking excels at grabbing attention and injecting a dose of urban cool into any design project.",
