    "detailed_description": "Dker Feltpen embodies the casual, expressive energy of handwritten typography. Its irregular letterforms, with varying stroke weights and subtly rounded terminals, evoke the immediacy of a felt-tip pen. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility, even at smaller sizes, while the inconsistent baseline and occasional overshoots add a touch of playful imperfection. This combination of technical clarity and expressive freedom makes Dker Feltpen ideal for projects that prioritize authenticity and personality. Its informal character suggests a connection to personal expression and DIY aesthetics, making it suitable for branding, social media graphics, and hand-crafted designs. The font's inherent warmth and approachability evoke a sense of community and shared experience, aligning it with contemporary trends in digital communication.",
