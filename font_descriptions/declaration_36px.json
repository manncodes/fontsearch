    "detailed_description": "Declaration is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise angles and sharp corners, creating a sense of clarity and precision. The letterforms are designed with a consistent stroke weight, resulting in a bold and confident appearance. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals add a touch of approachability, softening the otherwise rigid geometry.

Its futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of innovation and technological advancement, making it ideal for projects that require a modern and forward-thinking feel. The font's bold and confident character suggests strength, power, and authority, while its clean and legible design ensures readability across various media.",
