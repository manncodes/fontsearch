    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its unique, jagged outline, resembling a flame or a serrated edge. This unconventional construction creates a bold, attention-grabbing visual impact, instantly setting it apart from more traditional typefaces. The letterforms themselves are generally geometric, with a strong emphasis on straight lines and sharp angles, contributing to a sense of angularity and dynamism. The overall effect is one of raw energy and unconventionality, suggesting a rebellious spirit and a disregard for traditional typographic norms. While the jagged outline might seem aggressive at first glance, the font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, making it suitable for headlines and display applications where its bold personality can shine. The font's unconventional nature makes it particularly well-suited for projects that demand a strong visual statement, such as branding for edgy streetwear brands, music festivals, or rebellious tech startups. It evokes a sense of rebellion and unconventionality, suggesting a brand that is not afraid to break the mold and challenge expectations.",
