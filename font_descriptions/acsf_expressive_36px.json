    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its precise construction and consistent proportions. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The terminals are sharp and angular, contributing to a sense of modernity and efficiency. The x-height is relatively high, enhancing legibility, particularly in smaller sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of formality. It draws inspiration from the modernist design principles of the mid-20th century, particularly the emphasis on clarity and functionality. This font is well-suited for contemporary applications, such as branding, web design, and editorial layouts. Its clean lines and strong presence make it ideal for conveying professionalism and authority. The font's geometric structure and sharp angles evoke a sense of precision and order, suggesting a focus on logic and efficiency. This association with rationality and clarity makes it particularly relevant in the digital age, where information is often presented in a structured and concise manner.",
