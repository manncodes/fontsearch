    "detailed_description": "BudBird is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that feels both modern and approachable. The letterforms are built on a grid system, with clean lines and consistent proportions, giving the font a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth makes BudBird versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to editorial design. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital media. Its clean lines and contemporary feel make it a good choice for projects that require a modern and professional aesthetic, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for projects that need to convey a sense of friendliness and approachability.",
