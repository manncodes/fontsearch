    "detailed_description": "HelvetiHand is a sans-serif typeface that blends the clean geometry of Helvetica with a subtle, hand-drawn quality. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in consistent proportions and a sense of order. However, the letterforms are not perfectly geometric, with slight variations in stroke thickness and rounded terminals that add a touch of warmth and personality. This combination of structure and organic detail creates a unique visual balance, making the font feel both modern and approachable. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website headers to printed materials. The overall character of HelvetiHand is confident yet friendly, suggesting a balance of professionalism and approachability. It evokes a sense of modern design, but with a nod to the classic, hand-crafted aesthetic. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, contemporary look without feeling overly sterile or cold.",
