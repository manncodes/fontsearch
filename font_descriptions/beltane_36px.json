    "detailed_description": "Beltane is a display typeface that blends a classic serif structure with a distinctly playful, almost whimsical, personality. Its construction is rooted in traditional letterforms, featuring a strong baseline, well-defined serifs, and a consistent stroke weight. However, the font's character is defined by its exaggerated details, such as the rounded terminals, the slightly condensed proportions, and the playful flourishes on certain letters like 'g' and 'y'. These elements create a sense of movement and energy, making the font feel both familiar and slightly offbeat. While its classic structure ensures legibility, the playful details make it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a touch of personality is desired. Beltane's overall effect is one of charming eccentricity, suggesting a blend of vintage charm and modern whimsy, making it suitable for projects that aim to evoke a sense of playful sophistication.",
