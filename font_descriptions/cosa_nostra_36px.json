    "detailed_description": "Rosa Nostra 36pt is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct 3D extrusion effect. The letters are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a strong, confident presence. The extrusion adds a playful dimension, giving the font a sense of depth and movement. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The overall character is playful yet sophisticated, with a retro-futuristic vibe that evokes the bold graphics of the 1980s. This font is well-suited for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual impact. Its playful nature makes it ideal for use in digital media, particularly in gaming and entertainment contexts. The 3D effect adds a touch of whimsy and dynamism, making it a great choice for projects that aim to stand out.",
