    "detailed_description": "Gardens C exhibits a clean, contemporary aesthetic rooted in geometric construction. Its lowercase letters are particularly striking, with a consistent, almost circular, form that creates a sense of unity and balance. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The subtle curves in the terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Gardens C versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and modern feel evoke a sense of clarity and efficiency, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable. The font's overall character is one of confident simplicity, making it a strong choice for projects that prioritize readability and a clean, modern aesthetic.",
