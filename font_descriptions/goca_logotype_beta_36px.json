    "detailed_description": "GOCA Logotype Beta is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of retrofuturism and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its construction relies on a series of circular arcs and straight lines, resulting in a clean, uncluttered appearance. The rounded terminals and open counters contribute to a sense of openness and approachability, while the consistent stroke weight and lack of serifs maintain a sense of modernity. The font's high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. This combination of technical precision and visual appeal makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and web design to editorial and interface design. The font's bold, confident character evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of the design trends of the 1970s and 1980s, while its clean lines and contemporary proportions ensure its relevance in today's digital landscape.",
