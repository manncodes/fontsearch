    "detailed_description": "Frederick Sans embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with a subtle humanist touch. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural proportions, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the sharp, unornamented terminals. This geometric foundation gives the font a sense of order and clarity, making it highly legible even at small sizes. However, the slight rounding of the terminals and the subtle curves in letters like 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a font that is both modern and timeless, suitable for a wide range of applications. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design, while its subtle warmth and approachability ensure it doesn't feel overly corporate or formal. Frederick Sans evokes a sense of confidence and professionalism, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic resonate with contemporary design trends, while its subtle humanist touches ensure it remains approachable and engaging.",
