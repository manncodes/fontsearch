    "detailed_description": "Geometrico is a sans-serif typeface built on a strict geometric construction, with each letterform composed of straight lines and precise angles. This creates a clean, modern aesthetic that feels both minimalist and sophisticated. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall character of Geometrico is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy in the slightly rounded terminals of some letters. This balance between formality and approachability makes it versatile for a range of projects, from corporate branding to contemporary design. The font's geometric construction evokes a sense of order and precision, while the subtle curves add a touch of humanity, suggesting a balance between technology and human experience. Geometrico's clean lines and modern aesthetic make it a perfect choice for projects that require a sense of clarity, efficiency, and forward-thinking design.",
