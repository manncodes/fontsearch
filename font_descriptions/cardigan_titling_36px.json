    "detailed_description": "Cardigan Titling is a display typeface that blends a classic titling aesthetic with a contemporary, almost playful edge. Its construction is based on a strong geometric framework, evident in the consistent widths of the letterforms and the sharp, angular terminals. This geometric foundation gives the font a sense of order and clarity, making it highly legible even at large sizes. However, the design is softened by subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded corners of the lowercase 'a' and 'e', and the gentle curves of the 's' and 'c'. These details add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. The overall effect is a typeface that is both confident and inviting, capable of conveying a sense of authority while remaining approachable and engaging. Cardigan Titling is well-suited for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. Its bold, confident character makes it ideal for branding, advertising, and editorial design, while its playful elements allow it to be used effectively in more informal contexts. The font's contemporary feel, with its sharp angles and bold strokes, suggests a connection to digital culture and modern design trends, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of projects.",
