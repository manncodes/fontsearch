    "detailed_description": "Lunacy More is a display typeface that draws inspiration from gothic script, but with a playful, almost cartoonish twist. The letterforms are highly stylized, with exaggerated strokes and sharp angles that create a sense of energy and movement. The font's irregular baseline and inconsistent letter spacing contribute to its whimsical character, making it feel less formal and more expressive. While the overall design is reminiscent of medieval calligraphy, the exaggerated features and digital execution give it a distinctly modern feel. Lunacy More is best suited for short headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where its bold personality can shine. Its unique character makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of whimsy or a sense of playful rebellion.",
