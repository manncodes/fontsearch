    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold and expressive display typeface that draws inspiration from graffiti and street art. Its characters are characterized by exaggerated strokes, sharp angles, and a dynamic sense of movement. The letterforms are often fragmented and overlapping, creating a sense of energy and chaos. The font's irregular baseline and inconsistent letter spacing further contribute to its raw and unpolished aesthetic. While the font's technical construction is less precise than traditional typefaces, its deliberate imperfections add to its unique character. The font's bold and energetic personality makes it ideal for headlines, posters, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. It evokes a sense of urban grit and rebellious spirit, reflecting the raw energy and creativity of street culture.",
