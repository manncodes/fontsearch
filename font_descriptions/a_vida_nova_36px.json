    "detailed_description": "A Vida Nova is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost chaotic energy. Its construction is characterized by bold, irregular strokes with exaggerated curves and sharp angles, creating a sense of dynamism and unpredictability. The letterforms are often asymmetrical, with varying widths and heights, adding to the overall sense of movement. The font's rough, hand-drawn aesthetic evokes a sense of immediacy and authenticity, as if each letter was created with a single, bold stroke. This raw, unrefined quality makes it ideal for projects that require a bold, attention-grabbing presence, such as posters, headlines, or branding for edgy, creative ventures. While its legibility can be challenging in smaller sizes, its impact at larger scales is undeniable, making it a powerful tool for conveying a sense of energy, rebellion, and individuality.",
