    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement in geometric sans-serif design. Its construction is strictly rectilinear, with each letterform built from a series of sharp angles and straight lines. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to a sense of openness and legibility, while the tight letter spacing creates a compact and assertive feel. The terminals are often abrupt, adding to the font's angularity and sense of dynamism. The overall effect is one of starkness and precision, reminiscent of early digital typography and the graphic design of the 1980s. This font is not for the faint of heart; it demands attention and projects a sense of confidence and authority. Its bold, geometric nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its lack of serifs and its starkness might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes. The font's cultural associations are rooted in the early days of digital design and the rise of cyberpunk aesthetics, evoking a sense of futuristic urbanity and technological advancement.",
