    "detailed_description": "Kempco Smooth is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and sharp corners. The letterforms are designed with a strong emphasis on horizontal and vertical strokes, creating a sense of solidity and stability. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy. It evokes a sense of the 1980s, reminiscent of arcade games and early computer graphics. This retro aesthetic, combined with its strong legibility, makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces that require a bold and impactful visual presence. The font's technical limitations lie in its limited character set and lack of stylistic alternates, which may restrict its use in more complex typographic designs.",
