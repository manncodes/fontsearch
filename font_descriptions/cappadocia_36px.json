    "detailed_description": "Cappadocia is a playful display font that combines a retro-inspired aesthetic with a modern digital sensibility. Its construction is based on a simple geometric framework, with rounded corners and slightly exaggerated curves. This gives the font a sense of whimsy and energy, while still maintaining a degree of legibility. The use of double outlines adds a sense of depth and dimension, further enhancing its playful character. The font's overall mood is lighthearted and optimistic, evoking a sense of fun and nostalgia. It's well-suited for headlines, logos, and other graphic elements where a touch of personality is desired. Its retro-inspired aesthetic makes it particularly effective for projects that aim to capture a vintage feel, while its digital-friendly construction ensures it can be used effectively in a variety of contemporary applications.",
