    "detailed_description": "Comet is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on simple, boxy shapes with sharp corners and minimal curves, giving it a strong, almost mechanical aesthetic. The letters are tightly spaced, creating a dense and compact visual impact. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of confident energy and playful irreverence, reminiscent of 1980s sci-fi and video game graphics. This makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual presence and a touch of retro charm. While its bold nature might limit its use in large blocks of text, it excels in short bursts, adding a punchy and memorable element to any design.",
