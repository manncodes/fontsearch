    "detailed_description": "Astaqa Dragon is a bold, expressive display typeface that draws inspiration from both classic graffiti and contemporary digital art. Its exaggerated letterforms, characterized by sharp angles, dramatic curves, and dynamic strokes, create a sense of energy and movement. The font's construction is primarily organic, with each letterform feeling hand-drawn and slightly irregular, adding to its raw and authentic aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at large sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other impactful applications. The font's bold personality and playful nature make it ideal for projects that require a sense of excitement and individuality, while its digital-native aesthetic aligns well with contemporary design trends. While its irregular nature might limit its use in extended body text, Astaqa Dragon excels in capturing attention and conveying a sense of youthful energy.",
