    "detailed_description": "Good Timing is a geometric sans-serif typeface with a strong, confident presence. Its construction is based on precise angles and clean lines, creating a sense of order and clarity. The letterforms are bold and slightly condensed, with a high x-height that ensures excellent legibility even at small sizes. The terminals are sharp and angular, adding to the font's assertive character. While the overall design is geometric, subtle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g' introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or robotic. This balance between geometric precision and subtle warmth makes Good Timing suitable for a wide range of applications, from bold headlines and branding to user interfaces and digital displays. Its strong visual impact and clear readability make it ideal for conveying a message of authority and confidence, while its subtle human touch ensures it remains approachable and engaging. The font's bold, geometric aesthetic evokes a sense of modernism and technological advancement, making it a fitting choice for projects that aim to communicate innovation and progress.",
