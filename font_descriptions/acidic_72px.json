    "detailed_description": "This font, aptly named \"Acidic\", is a bold and highly stylized typeface characterized by its rough, pixelated, and slightly distorted appearance. The letters are formed by a collection of small, irregular dots, giving the impression of a grainy, almost digital texture. This texture adds a sense of grit and energy to the font, making it visually striking and attention-grabbing. The overall style is reminiscent of early computer graphics or pixel art, lending a retro and somewhat chaotic aesthetic.",
