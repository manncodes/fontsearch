    "detailed_description": "Estrategia is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that draws inspiration from both vintage and contemporary design trends. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, crisp lines and consistent proportions. The letters are composed of simple, rounded shapes with a distinctive pattern of small circles embedded within their outlines. This pattern adds a playful, almost pixelated texture, reminiscent of early video game graphics or retro digital interfaces. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold weight and playful texture lend it a sense of energy and dynamism, making it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence. Estrategia's retro aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia and playful experimentation, while its geometric construction and clean lines maintain a sense of professionalism and modernity. It's a versatile font that can be used to create a wide range of visual styles, from playful and retro to bold and contemporary.",
