    "detailed_description": "AUX is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of geometric influence. Its construction is characterized by a strong, consistent stroke weight throughout, creating a sense of visual unity and clarity. The letterforms are generally geometric in nature, with sharp corners and precise curves, but they are softened by subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase 'a' and 'g'. This balance between geometric precision and humanist warmth gives AUX a distinctive personality that is both professional and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from large-scale headlines to small-scale body text. Its clean lines and modern feel make it particularly well-suited for digital interfaces, branding, and editorial design. AUX evokes a sense of confidence and clarity, suggesting a brand that is both innovative and reliable. Its contemporary aesthetic aligns with current trends in digital design, while its timeless qualities ensure its relevance for years to come.",
