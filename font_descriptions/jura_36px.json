    "detailed_description": "Jura is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic. Its geometric construction, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths, creates a sense of order and precision. The font's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The slightly rounded terminals, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly cold or sterile. This balance between geometric structure and subtle humanist details gives Jura a versatile personality, capable of conveying both professionalism and a sense of contemporary style. Its clean lines and strong legibility make it ideal for branding, web design, and user interfaces, while its modern aesthetic aligns well with digital-native design trends. Jura's overall character evokes a sense of clarity, efficiency, and forward-thinking, making it a suitable choice for projects that require a clean and modern visual identity.",
