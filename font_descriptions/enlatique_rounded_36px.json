    "detailed_description": "Enlatigue Rounded is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its forms are primarily based on circles and squares, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic.

This combination of geometric precision and humanist warmth makes Enlatigue Rounded versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of efficiency and modernity, while the rounded terminals suggest a friendly and approachable personality. The font's versatility and adaptability make it a strong choice for projects that require a balance of professionalism and approachability.",
