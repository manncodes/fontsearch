    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of geometric simplicity, built on a grid with sharp, unmodulated strokes. The letterforms are constructed with a strict adherence to right angles and horizontal/vertical lines, creating a sense of starkness and directness. The x-height is high, and the counters are open, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The overall effect is one of confident clarity, with a touch of retro-futuristic coolness. The font's bold, unyielding nature makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. It evokes a sense of power and authority, reminiscent of early computer interfaces and futuristic sci-fi aesthetics. However, its clean lines and strong legibility also lend it a sense of accessibility, making it suitable for a range of contemporary applications.",
