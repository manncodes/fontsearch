    "detailed_description": "Boemio PX is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet sophisticated approach to 3D letterforms. Its construction is based on a geometric framework, with each letter meticulously crafted as a series of extruded polygons. This results in a bold, eye-catching aesthetic that evokes a sense of playful dimensionality. The font's sharp angles and clean lines contribute to a sense of modernity, while the subtle variations in the depth of the extrusion add a touch of visual interest. The overall effect is a font that is both striking and approachable, suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where a strong visual impact is desired. While its bold nature makes it ideal for large-scale displays, Boemio PX can also be used effectively in smaller sizes, particularly when paired with a complementary sans-serif typeface for body text. Its unique character and playful personality make it a versatile tool for designers seeking to add a touch of whimsy and sophistication to their projects.",
