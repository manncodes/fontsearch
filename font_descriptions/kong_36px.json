    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its consistent, almost architectural construction. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean, precise aesthetic. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, making it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text blocks. The overall character is bold and confident, yet the slightly rounded terminals and subtle variations in stroke weight introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a font that feels both modern and timeless. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of authority and professionalism, while its subtle warmth suggests a human touch. This combination makes it ideal for projects that require a balance of sophistication and approachability.",
