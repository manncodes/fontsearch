    "detailed_description": "Layered Letters is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct futuristic aesthetic. Its construction relies on a series of overlapping planes, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. The letters are composed of sharp, angular forms with minimal curves, resulting in a bold and assertive presence. This layered structure, while visually striking, can lead to some legibility challenges, particularly in smaller sizes or when used in complex layouts. Despite its technical complexity, Layered Letters possesses a playful and energetic personality, reminiscent of early video game graphics or science fiction imagery. Its bold, angular forms evoke a sense of speed and dynamism, making it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its unique construction and potential legibility issues should be carefully considered when choosing applications.",
