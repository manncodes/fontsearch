    "detailed_description": "Caramella is a sans-serif typeface that balances a clean, geometric construction with subtle humanist details. Its open counters and generous x-height contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The slightly rounded terminals and gentle curves in the lowercase letters add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This combination of clarity and warmth makes Caramella suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and mobile apps. Its contemporary aesthetic, with a hint of retro charm, evokes a sense of optimism and approachability, making it ideal for projects that require a friendly and engaging tone. The font's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive character set, including a variety of ligatures and stylistic alternates, allowing for creative customization and unique typographic expressions.",
