    "detailed_description": "Last Dance is a display typeface that embodies a playful, almost childlike energy. Its rounded, organic forms are reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, with each character exhibiting a unique, slightly wobbly charm. The font's construction is decidedly informal, with inconsistent stroke weights and a lack of strict geometric precision. This informality contributes to its friendly, approachable personality. While the overall design is casual, the bold weight and generous x-height ensure good legibility, making it suitable for headlines, posters, and other large-scale applications. The font's playful nature evokes a sense of fun and nostalgia, reminiscent of childhood scribbles and carefree expression. It's a font that invites interaction and engagement, making it ideal for projects that aim to capture a sense of joy and spontaneity.",
