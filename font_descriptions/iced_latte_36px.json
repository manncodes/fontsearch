    "detailed_description": "This font embodies a casual, handwritten aesthetic with a touch of playful energy. Its construction is largely organic, with letterforms that flow naturally and exhibit slight variations in stroke thickness. The ascenders and descenders are pronounced, contributing to a sense of dynamism and informality. While the overall impression is relaxed, the font maintains a degree of legibility through its clear, open counters and consistent letter spacing. The slightly rounded terminals and occasional playful flourishes add a touch of personality, making it suitable for projects that require a friendly and approachable tone. Its informal character makes it ideal for casual branding, social media graphics, or handwritten notes, while its legibility ensures readability even in smaller sizes.",
