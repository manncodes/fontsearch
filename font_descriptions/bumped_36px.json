    "detailed_description": "Bumped (36px) is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct outline style. Its construction is based on simple, clean shapes with sharp corners and a consistent stroke weight. The letters are designed with a high x-height and open counters, ensuring strong legibility even at small sizes. The outline effect adds a playful and retro feel, reminiscent of early digital graphics and video game aesthetics. This combination of geometric precision and playful outline creates a font that is both modern and nostalgic, suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a bold and eye-catching statement is desired. While its bold nature makes it ideal for large-scale applications, it can also be used effectively in smaller sizes for digital interfaces, particularly in contexts where a retro or playful aesthetic is desired.",
