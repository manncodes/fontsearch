    "detailed_description": "Extremis 36px is a geometric sans-serif typeface characterized by its bold, angular forms and a distinct lack of curves. The letters are constructed with sharp corners and straight lines, creating a clean, modern aesthetic. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. The consistent stroke weight and minimal variation in letterforms contribute to its streamlined appearance. This starkness, however, is tempered by subtle details like the slightly rounded terminals, which add a touch of approachability and prevent the font from feeling overly cold or rigid. Extremis 36px exudes a sense of confidence and authority, reminiscent of futuristic technology and minimalist design. Its bold presence makes it suitable for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. However, its lack of stylistic variation might limit its use in extended text blocks, particularly at smaller sizes.",
