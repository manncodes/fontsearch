    "detailed_description": "Fustered Brush 36px is a display typeface that captures the energy and immediacy of hand-drawn lettering. Its irregular strokes, varying weights, and expressive letterforms evoke the spontaneity of brush calligraphy. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at large sizes, while the uneven baseline and dynamic ascenders and descenders add a sense of movement and rhythm. This combination of legibility and expressiveness makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and other applications where a bold and impactful visual statement is desired. The font's hand-drawn aesthetic suggests a sense of authenticity and personality, making it suitable for projects that aim to convey a sense of creativity, individuality, or informality. Its contemporary relevance lies in its ability to capture the spirit of digital culture, where hand-drawn elements are often used to add a personal touch to digital designs.",
