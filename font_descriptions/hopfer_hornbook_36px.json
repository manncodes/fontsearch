    "detailed_description": "Hopper Hornbook is a serif typeface that blends classic typographic principles with a contemporary sensibility. Its construction is rooted in traditional letterforms, featuring a moderate x-height, balanced proportions, and a consistent stroke weight. The serifs are delicate and slightly bracketed, adding a touch of elegance. However, the overall feel is not overly formal, as the letterforms exhibit a subtle playfulness in their curves and angles. The 'Q' and 'R' are particularly distinctive, with their extended tails adding a touch of whimsy. The font's high legibility makes it suitable for both print and digital applications, particularly in body text and editorial design. Its classic yet approachable character evokes a sense of timeless sophistication, making it ideal for projects that require a balance of tradition and modernity.",
