    "detailed_description": "JD Estrellas is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a touch of retro charm. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. The slightly rounded terminals, however, soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and warmth. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives the font a distinctive personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. The font's overall character evokes a sense of optimism and confidence, reminiscent of mid-century modern design, while its clean lines and contemporary proportions make it feel fresh and relevant for today's digital landscape.",
