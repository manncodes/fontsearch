    "detailed_description": "Ardenas is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of humanist warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the consistent, almost architectural proportions of the letterforms, particularly in the uppercase characters. The terminals, however, are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall impression. This balance between geometric precision and humanist detail creates a typeface that feels both contemporary and timeless. The high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from website copy to branding materials. The overall character of Ardenas is one of confident clarity and understated elegance, making it a versatile choice for projects that require a clean, modern look without sacrificing readability or personality.",
