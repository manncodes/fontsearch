    "detailed_description": "Conventional Wisdom is a bold, playful display typeface that draws inspiration from both vintage signage and contemporary digital aesthetics. Its chunky, geometric letterforms are built with sharp angles and irregular, almost jagged, outlines. This creates a sense of energy and dynamism, while the consistent weight and bold strokes ensure strong legibility even at large sizes. The font's playful nature is further emphasized by the inclusion of unique glyphs for punctuation and symbols, adding a touch of whimsy to its overall character. While its bold, graphic style makes it ideal for headlines and branding elements, its playful nature also lends itself to use in children's books, game design, and other creative applications where a sense of fun and energy is desired. The font's bold, graphic style evokes a sense of retro nostalgia, reminiscent of vintage signage and comic book lettering, while its playful nature suggests a contemporary, digital-native design sensibility.",
