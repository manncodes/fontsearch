    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, evident in its precise construction and consistent proportions. The letterforms are built upon a grid system, resulting in a clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The terminals are sharp and angular, contributing to a sense of modernity and efficiency. The x-height is relatively high, ensuring excellent legibility even at small sizes. The overall character of the font is confident and assertive, with a touch of playful energy. It draws inspiration from the geometric sans-serif styles of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary twist. The font's clean lines and bold forms make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. Its assertive personality and modern aesthetic make it particularly well-suited for projects that require a strong visual presence and a sense of forward momentum.",
