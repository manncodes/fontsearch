    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong geometric foundation, with letterforms constructed from circles, squares, and straight lines. The consistent use of rounded terminals and open counters creates a sense of openness and approachability, softening the otherwise rigid structure. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, especially in smaller sizes. The overall design evokes a sense of modernism, with a clean and uncluttered aesthetic that feels both timeless and contemporary. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's clean lines and bold forms suggest a sense of confidence and authority, while its rounded details add a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance makes it ideal for projects that require a strong visual presence without feeling overly formal or cold.",
