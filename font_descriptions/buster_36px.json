    "detailed_description": "Buster is a geometric sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct retro-futuristic aesthetic. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in clean, sharp lines and consistent proportions. The letterforms are composed of simple, angular shapes with minimal curves, creating a sense of precision and order. The high x-height and open counters contribute to excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The font's bold weight and strong stroke contrast add to its assertive character, while the slightly rounded terminals soften the overall impression, preventing it from feeling overly cold or harsh. Buster's design evokes a sense of technological advancement and futuristic optimism, reminiscent of 1980s science fiction films and video games. Its bold, confident presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and interface design, particularly in contexts where a futuristic or technological theme is desired. However, its strong personality might not be suitable for all applications, especially those requiring a more delicate or traditional touch.",
