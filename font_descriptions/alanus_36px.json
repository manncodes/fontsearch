    "detailed_description": "Aianus is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle nod to classic geometric design principles. Its construction is characterized by a strong, consistent stroke weight throughout, creating a sense of visual unity and clarity. The letterforms are geometrically balanced, with precise angles and a consistent baseline, resulting in a highly legible and structured appearance. The terminals, while primarily geometric, exhibit a slight rounding, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall impression. This subtle detail prevents the font from feeling overly rigid or cold, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The font's high x-height and open counters further enhance its legibility, ensuring readability even at smaller sizes. Aianus's overall character is one of confident simplicity and modern sophistication, making it ideal for branding, editorial design, and digital interfaces. Its clean lines and geometric structure evoke a sense of order and professionalism, while the subtle rounding of the terminals adds a touch of warmth and approachability. The font's versatility allows it to seamlessly transition from large-scale headlines to smaller body text, making it a valuable tool for designers seeking a contemporary and reliable typeface.",
