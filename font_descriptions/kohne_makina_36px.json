    "detailed_description": "Kohne Makina is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and organic warmth. Its construction is rooted in a strong, almost architectural grid, evident in the consistent width of letterforms and the sharp, clean angles of its terminals. However, the font avoids feeling overly rigid through subtle curves and rounded corners, particularly noticeable in the lowercase 'a' and 'o'. This balance creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from large-scale signage to digital interfaces. Its bold weight and confident presence suggest a sense of authority and modernity, while the subtle curves and rounded corners add a touch of approachability and warmth. This combination makes Kohne Makina a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of strength and approachability, evoking a sense of contemporary design with a touch of retro charm.",
