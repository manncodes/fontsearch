    "detailed_description": "Cleopatra is a display typeface that draws inspiration from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, reimagining them as a bold and angular script. Each letterform is constructed from a series of sharp, geometric shapes, creating a striking visual impact. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure legibility even at large sizes, while the dramatic angles and sharp terminals contribute to its assertive personality. Cleopatra's bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects that require a strong visual presence. Its historical references evoke a sense of mystery and power, while its contemporary design language feels both edgy and timeless. The font's versatility allows it to be used in a variety of contexts, from fashion and music to technology and gaming, adding a touch of intrigue and sophistication to any project.",
