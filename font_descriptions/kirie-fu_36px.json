    "detailed_description": "Kiri-Fu is a bold, geometric sans-serif font that exudes a confident and modern aesthetic. Its construction is based on precise geometric shapes, resulting in a clean and crisp appearance. The letterforms are characterized by strong vertical strokes, open counters, and a high x-height, contributing to its excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability and softening the overall geometric feel. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism makes Kiri-Fu versatile for a range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its bold weight and strong presence make it ideal for headlines and titles, while its clean lines and high legibility ensure readability in body text. The font's contemporary design evokes a sense of innovation and forward-thinking, making it a suitable choice for projects that aim to convey a modern and dynamic personality. Its bold and confident character aligns well with brands and projects that emphasize strength, clarity, and a forward-looking vision.",
