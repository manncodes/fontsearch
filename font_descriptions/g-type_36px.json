    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its geometric construction, where each letterform is built from a series of precisely aligned squares and rectangles. This creates a stark, almost architectural feel, reminiscent of early digital interfaces or pixelated graphics. The consistent stroke weight and sharp corners contribute to a sense of rigidity and order, while the double-line construction adds a subtle layer of depth and dimension. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. Its bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements that demand attention and a sense of authority. The font's retro-futuristic aesthetic evokes a sense of nostalgia for the early days of computing, while its clean lines and sharp edges suggest a modern, minimalist sensibility. It's a versatile font that can be used to create a range of visual effects, from playful and whimsical to serious and sophisticated.",
