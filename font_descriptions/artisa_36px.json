    "detailed_description": "Artisa is a display typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist touches, resulting in a font that is both striking and approachable. The letters are constructed with clean, sharp lines and angles, giving the font a modern and confident feel. However, the slightly rounded terminals and the overall proportions of the letters create a sense of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly cold or sterile. The high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for a variety of applications. Artisa's bold and confident character makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding projects, while its approachability allows it to be used for more extended text, particularly in digital environments. The font's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of retro-futurism, drawing inspiration from mid-century design trends while maintaining a contemporary feel. This makes it a versatile choice for projects that require a balance of classic and modern aesthetics.",
