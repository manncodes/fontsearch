    "detailed_description": "Jetthose is a geometric sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from the digital aesthetic of the 1980s. Its construction is based on a grid system, resulting in a clean and precise appearance. The letters are composed of straight lines and sharp corners, creating a sense of rigidity and order. The font's distinctive feature is its use of pixelated elements, which are incorporated into the letterforms, adding a retro-futuristic touch. This pixelation, while subtle, adds a layer of texture and visual interest, making the font feel both modern and nostalgic. The overall character of Jetthose is bold and confident, with a hint of playfulness. It evokes a sense of technological advancement and the excitement of a new era. Its practical applications include headlines, logos, and digital interfaces, where its strong visual presence and retro charm can be effectively utilized. The font's pixelated nature makes it particularly well-suited for digital displays and web design, where its retro aesthetic can add a unique touch to contemporary projects.",
