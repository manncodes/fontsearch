    "detailed_description": "Anne Sans is a geometric sans-serif typeface built entirely from repeating square modules. This construction creates a distinctive visual texture, reminiscent of pixelated graphics or early digital displays. The font's rigid structure and consistent module size lend it a strong, almost mechanical feel, yet the subtle variations in the module arrangement within each letterform add a touch of visual interest and prevent monotony. The overall effect is a balance between stark geometric precision and a hint of playful irregularity. Anne Sans is well-suited for digital interfaces, particularly those with a retro or minimalist aesthetic. Its bold, graphic nature makes it ideal for headlines, logos, and branding elements, while its legibility at smaller sizes allows for use in body text as well. The font's association with digital technology and its playful yet structured personality make it a compelling choice for projects seeking a contemporary edge with a nod to the past.",
