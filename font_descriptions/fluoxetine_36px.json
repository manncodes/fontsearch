    "detailed_description": "Fluoxetine is a sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from vintage typewriter fonts, but with a contemporary twist. Its geometric construction, evident in the clean lines and consistent stroke widths, gives it a modern feel. The slightly rounded terminals, however, add a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing it from feeling overly sterile. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. The overall character of Fluoxetine is both confident and approachable, suggesting a balance between professionalism and approachability. It evokes a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era of typewriters and mechanical printing, but with a modern sensibility that makes it feel fresh and relevant. This blend of vintage charm and contemporary design makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of authenticity.",
