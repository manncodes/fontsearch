    "detailed_description": "Frankstern is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a distinct blend of geometric precision and subtle humanist warmth. Its construction is rooted in a strong, almost architectural grid, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, unornamented terminals. This geometric foundation lends a sense of clarity and order, making it ideal for applications demanding legibility and visual impact. However, the font avoids feeling overly cold or sterile through the introduction of subtle curves in the lowercase letters, particularly in the 'a', 'g', and 'o'. These gentle curves soften the overall impression, adding a touch of approachability and personality. The high x-height and open counters further enhance readability, ensuring that the font remains clear and engaging even at smaller sizes. This combination of geometric structure and humanist detail makes Frankstern a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic resonate with contemporary design sensibilities, while its subtle warmth and approachability make it suitable for projects seeking a balance between professionalism and human connection.",
