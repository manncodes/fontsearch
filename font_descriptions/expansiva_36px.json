    "detailed_description": "Expansiva is a sans-serif typeface characterized by its distinctive angled construction and bold, geometric forms. Each letter is built from a series of sharp, angled lines, creating a sense of dynamism and forward motion. The consistent slant and open counters contribute to its strong legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is confident and modern, with a hint of futuristic edge. It draws inspiration from the geometric sans-serifs of the early 20th century, but with a contemporary twist. Expansiva's bold, angular forms and dynamic slant make it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces where a strong visual impact is desired. Its futuristic aesthetic aligns well with technology-focused projects, while its clear legibility ensures readability across various media. The font's bold, angular forms evoke a sense of speed and progress, suggesting a forward-thinking and innovative spirit.",
