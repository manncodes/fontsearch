    "detailed_description": "Gel Dottica is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letterforms are constructed with clean, precise lines and open counters, creating a sense of clarity and legibility. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed proportions add a touch of warmth and personality, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric structure and humanist details makes Gel Dottica versatile for a range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. Its strong legibility and contemporary aesthetic make it suitable for both large-scale displays and smaller text sizes, while its playful character adds a touch of personality to any design. The font's overall impression is one of confidence and approachability, suggesting a brand that is both professional and engaging.",
