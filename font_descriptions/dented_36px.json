    "detailed_description": "Dented is a sans-serif typeface that blends a geometric foundation with subtle humanist details, resulting in a unique visual character. The font's construction is primarily geometric, with clean lines and consistent stroke weights. However, the rounded terminals and slightly flared serifs on lowercase letters introduce a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the design from feeling overly rigid. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness gives Dented a distinctive personality, making it both modern and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The bold weight adds a touch of confidence and authority, while the regular weight maintains a friendly and approachable feel. Dented's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of playful experimentation, reminiscent of early digital design and the playful spirit of the 1980s. Its bold, yet approachable character makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from branding and editorial design to user interfaces and mobile apps.",
