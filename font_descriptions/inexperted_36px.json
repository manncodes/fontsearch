    "detailed_description": "This font, reminiscent of hand-drawn lettering, embodies a playful and energetic spirit. Its irregular letterforms, characterized by bold strokes and expressive curves, create a sense of spontaneity and immediacy. The uneven baseline and varying letter heights contribute to the hand-drawn aesthetic, while the overall structure remains legible and functional. The font's bold weight and generous x-height ensure visibility, making it suitable for headlines and display applications. Its informal character and energetic vibe make it ideal for projects that require a youthful and engaging tone, such as branding for streetwear, music festivals, or social media campaigns. The font's cultural associations lean towards contemporary street art and graffiti, evoking a sense of urban energy and creative expression.",
