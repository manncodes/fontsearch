    "detailed_description": "Braeside is a bold, geometric sans-serif font with a distinct stencil-like construction. Its uppercase characters are defined by a thick, consistent stroke weight and sharp, angular terminals, creating a strong, assertive presence. The letterforms are built on a grid system, resulting in a highly structured and balanced appearance. The generous x-height and open counters ensure excellent legibility, even at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is confident and commanding, evoking a sense of authority and power. It draws inspiration from classic stencil fonts, particularly those used in signage and industrial applications. However, Braeside's clean lines and modern proportions give it a contemporary edge, making it suitable for a wide range of digital and print projects. Its bold presence makes it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and signage, while its clear legibility ensures readability in both large and small sizes. The font's strong, geometric aesthetic suggests a sense of order and precision, making it a good choice for projects that require a sense of professionalism and authority.",
