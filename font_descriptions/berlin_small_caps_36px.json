    "detailed_description": "Berlin Small Caps is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, geometric aesthetic with subtle humanist touches. Its construction is based on precise, almost architectural proportions, evident in the consistent width of strokes and the sharp, unornamented terminals. The x-height is relatively high, contributing to excellent legibility, while the open counters enhance readability even at smaller sizes. The overall impression is one of clarity and confidence, yet the slightly rounded corners of the letterforms and the subtle variations in stroke weight introduce a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist nuance makes Berlin Small Caps suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. Its clean lines and strong presence evoke a sense of modernity and professionalism, while its subtle warmth and approachability prevent it from feeling overly sterile or cold. The font's contemporary relevance is further enhanced by its versatility across various media, from print to screen, and its ability to adapt to both large and small scales.",
