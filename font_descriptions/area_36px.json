    "detailed_description": "This font's defining characteristic is its bold, extruded 3D effect, achieved through multiple parallel outlines. This creates a sense of depth and dimensionality, reminiscent of early computer graphics or retro video game aesthetics. The letterforms themselves are based on a simple, rounded geometric construction, with consistent curves and minimal serifs. This geometric foundation contributes to a clean, modern feel, while the playful 3D effect adds a touch of whimsy and retro charm. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. However, the 3D effect can create visual noise when used in large blocks of text, limiting its effectiveness for extended reading. Despite its retro origins, the font's clean lines and bold presence make it surprisingly versatile, suitable for branding, headlines, and even playful digital interfaces, particularly those with a nostalgic or retro theme.",
