    "detailed_description": "This font is a bold statement of angularity, built entirely from sharp, geometric shapes. Each letter is constructed from a series of intersecting lines, creating a sense of rigid structure and deliberate design. The lack of curves or rounded terminals reinforces this stark, almost brutalist aesthetic. While the font's construction is highly geometric, it avoids feeling overly sterile due to the slight variations in stroke thickness and the occasional subtle curve in a terminal. This adds a touch of human imperfection, grounding the font's otherwise rigid character. The font's bold weight and large x-height ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes, making it suitable for headlines, logos, and other applications where impact is desired. However, its angularity and lack of serifs might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes. The font's overall impression is one of power, authority, and a touch of rebellion, evoking a sense of defiance against traditional typographic norms. It suggests a contemporary, urban aesthetic, perhaps associated with street art, graffiti, or underground culture.",
