    "detailed_description": "Dragon Caps is a display typeface that embodies a playful yet powerful aesthetic. Each letterform is intricately crafted as a stylized dragon, with the creature's body forming the letter's shape. The dragons are rendered in a bold, black silhouette, creating a strong visual impact. The font's construction is highly detailed, with intricate scales, wings, and claws meticulously sculpted into each letter. This level of detail contributes to the font's whimsical and fantastical character. While the font's primary focus is on visual impact, it maintains a degree of legibility, particularly in its lowercase forms, which are more traditional in their construction. The font's bold, black silhouette and intricate details make it ideal for eye-catching headlines, logos, and branding elements, particularly in fantasy-themed projects. Its playful nature also lends itself to children's books, game design, and other creative applications where a touch of whimsy is desired. Dragon Caps evokes a sense of medieval fantasy and adventure, transporting viewers to a world of mythical creatures and heroic tales. Its bold and playful nature suggests a sense of wonder and excitement, making it a perfect choice for projects that aim to capture the imagination.",
