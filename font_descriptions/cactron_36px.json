    "detailed_description": "Cactro is a geometric sans-serif font with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on clean, angular lines and precise curves, creating a strong, confident presence. The letterforms are tightly spaced, with a high x-height and open counters that ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes. The terminals are slightly rounded, adding a touch of approachability to the otherwise stark geometric forms. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanization gives Cactro a unique personality, making it both modern and nostalgic. Its bold, confident character makes it ideal for headlines, branding, and digital interfaces, particularly those with a retro or futuristic aesthetic. The font's strong visual impact and clear legibility make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from large-scale signage to small-scale web design. Cactro evokes a sense of optimism and technological advancement, reminiscent of the 1980s and early 1990s, while remaining relevant to contemporary design trends.",
