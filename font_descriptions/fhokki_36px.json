    "detailed_description": "This font exhibits a strong, geometric construction, evident in the precise angles and consistent proportions of its letterforms. The glyphs are characterized by a bold, almost monolinear stroke, creating a sense of solidity and clarity. The overall design is balanced and symmetrical, with a high x-height that contributes to its legibility. The font's bold weight and sharp terminals lend it a sense of authority and confidence, while the consistent stroke width and lack of embellishments suggest a modern, minimalist aesthetic. This combination of technical precision and visual impact makes it suitable for a range of applications, from branding and signage to editorial design and digital interfaces. The font's bold presence and clean lines evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its geometric structure suggests a sense of order and clarity. It carries a contemporary feel, suggesting a connection to modern design trends and digital culture.",
