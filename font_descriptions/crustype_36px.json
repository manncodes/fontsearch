    "detailed_description": "This font, with its bold, chunky letterforms and a distinct grunge aesthetic, embodies a raw, unpolished energy. The characters are constructed with a combination of geometric and organic elements, resulting in a unique visual language that feels both familiar and unexpected. The sharp angles and jagged edges create a sense of urgency and intensity, while the uneven stroke weights and distressed textures add a layer of grit and authenticity. This font is not afraid to be bold and assertive, making it ideal for projects that demand attention and convey a sense of rebellion or authenticity. Its rough-hewn nature suggests a DIY ethos, a rejection of polished perfection, and a celebration of imperfection. While its legibility is strong at larger sizes, its intricate details and unevenness might make it less suitable for smaller text or extended reading. This font is a powerful tool for expressing a raw, edgy, and authentic voice, particularly in contexts where a sense of rebellion or DIY spirit is desired.",
