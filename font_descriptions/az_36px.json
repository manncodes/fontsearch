    "detailed_description": "This font, with its double-line construction, presents a unique visual experience. The geometrically precise letterforms, characterized by sharp corners and consistent stroke widths, create a clean and modern aesthetic. The double lines, while adding visual weight, maintain a sense of openness due to the generous spacing between them. This creates a balance between boldness and legibility, making it suitable for both display and body text applications. The font's overall character is confident and assertive, yet it retains a sense of playfulness through the unexpected double-line treatment. This duality makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from branding and editorial design to digital interfaces and signage. The font's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to convey a sense of modernity and sophistication, while its double-line construction evokes a sense of retrofuturism, referencing a time when technology was both exciting and mysterious.",
