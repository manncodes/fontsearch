    "detailed_description": "Aubrey is a sans-serif typeface that blends a classic, geometric foundation with subtle humanist details. Its construction is rooted in a strong, consistent grid, evident in the upright, rectangular shapes of letters like 'H' and 'I'. This geometric core gives Aubrey a sense of clarity and order, making it feel both modern and timeless. However, the typeface avoids being overly rigid through the introduction of subtle curves in the terminals of letters like 'a' and 'c', adding a touch of warmth and approachability. This balance between geometric precision and humanist softness creates a typeface that is both legible and visually engaging. Aubrey's high x-height and open counters contribute to its excellent readability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from body text to headlines. The typeface's clean lines and neutral character make it a versatile choice for both print and digital media, particularly in contexts where a sense of professionalism and sophistication is desired. Aubrey's overall aesthetic evokes a sense of modernism, with a nod to the clean lines and functional design of the mid-century era. It feels both familiar and fresh, suggesting a timeless elegance that transcends trends.",
