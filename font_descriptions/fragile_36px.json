    "detailed_description": "Fragile is a font that embodies a delicate balance between classic and contemporary design. Its construction is rooted in a geometric framework, evident in the sharp angles and consistent stroke widths. However, the font's personality is softened by subtle humanist details, such as the slightly rounded terminals and the gentle curves in the lowercase letters. This combination creates a visual tension that is both intriguing and approachable. The font's high x-height and open counters ensure strong legibility, making it suitable for both print and digital applications. Its distinctive character, with its hint of vintage charm and a touch of modern edge, makes it ideal for projects that require a unique and memorable visual identity. Fragile's versatility allows it to be used for a wide range of purposes, from branding and editorial design to web interfaces and mobile applications. Its subtle texture and slightly distressed appearance evoke a sense of authenticity and handcrafted quality, adding a layer of warmth and personality to any design.",
