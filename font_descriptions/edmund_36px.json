    "detailed_description": "Edmund is a bold sans-serif typeface that draws inspiration from classic American signage and vintage printing. Its geometric construction is evident in the clean lines and consistent proportions of the letterforms, particularly in the uppercase characters. The rounded terminals and slightly condensed letter spacing, however, inject a touch of warmth and approachability, preventing the font from feeling overly rigid or cold. This balance between geometric precision and subtle humanism gives Edmund a distinctive personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its bold weight and strong legibility make it ideal for headlines, branding elements, and display purposes, while its vintage aesthetic lends itself to projects with a retro or nostalgic feel. Edmund's versatility allows it to be used in both traditional print media and digital environments, adding a touch of character and personality to any design.",
