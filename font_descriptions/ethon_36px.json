    "detailed_description": "Ethon is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with subtle hints of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Ethon a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. The font's overall character evokes a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle warmth makes it approachable and inviting. Ethon's contemporary design language suggests a connection to digital culture, while its clean lines and timeless elegance ensure its longevity.",
