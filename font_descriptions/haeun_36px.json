    "detailed_description": "Haeun is a playful script font that captures the energy of handwritten text. Its flowing strokes and organic curves create a sense of movement and informality, reminiscent of casual note-taking or personal correspondence. The font's generous x-height and open counters ensure good legibility, even at smaller sizes, making it suitable for both digital and print applications. The slightly irregular letterforms and subtle variations in stroke weight add a touch of personality and authenticity, while the overall structure remains consistent and balanced. Haeun's casual charm makes it ideal for branding projects that seek a friendly and approachable aesthetic, particularly in the realm of lifestyle, fashion, or creative industries. Its playful nature also lends itself well to social media graphics, invitations, and other projects where a personal touch is desired.",
