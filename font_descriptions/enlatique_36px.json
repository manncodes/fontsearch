    "detailed_description": "Enlatigue is a sans-serif typeface that embodies a clean, modern aesthetic with a subtle touch of warmth. Its geometric construction is evident in the precise angles and consistent stroke widths, creating a sense of order and clarity. However, the slightly rounded terminals and open counters introduce a touch of humanity, preventing the font from feeling overly sterile. This balance between geometric precision and organic detail gives Enlatigue a versatile personality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Its high x-height and generous spacing ensure excellent legibility, even at small sizes, making it ideal for digital interfaces and web design. The font's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and innovation, making it a strong choice for branding and marketing materials. Enlatigue's versatility and approachability make it a modern classic, capable of conveying both technical expertise and a touch of human connection.",
