    "detailed_description": "This font, named \"Alert Covid\", is a bold and expressive display typeface that leans heavily into a horror aesthetic. Its characters are rendered with thick, jagged strokes that evoke a sense of danger and urgency. The font's overall style is reminiscent of handwritten lettering, but with a deliberate, almost menacing quality. The letters are often elongated and distorted, adding to the sense of unease. The font includes a full set of uppercase letters, numbers, and punctuation marks, making it suitable for a variety of applications.",
