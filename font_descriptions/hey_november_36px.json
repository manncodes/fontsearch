    "detailed_description": "Hey November is a display typeface that captures the energy of hand-drawn lettering, with a distinct personality that leans towards the bold and expressive. The font's construction is characterized by its irregular, almost calligraphic strokes, with varying thicknesses and angles that create a dynamic and energetic feel. The letterforms are generally rounded, with a playful and slightly whimsical quality, particularly evident in the lowercase letters like 'a' and 'g'. The overall effect is one of spontaneity and authenticity, as if the letters were drawn quickly and with a sense of freedom. This makes it ideal for projects that require a touch of personality and a sense of immediacy, such as branding for creative agencies, streetwear designs, or social media graphics. The font's bold and expressive nature also lends itself well to headlines and titles, adding a touch of excitement and energy to any design. However, its irregular nature might make it less suitable for extended body text, especially at smaller sizes, where legibility could be compromised.",
