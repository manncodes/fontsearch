    "detailed_description": "Bernardo Moda is a sans-serif typeface that blends geometric construction with subtle humanist details, resulting in a font that is both modern and approachable. The letters are built on a grid system, giving them a clean and precise feel, but the slightly rounded terminals and open counters add a touch of warmth and personality. The high x-height and generous spacing ensure strong legibility, even at small sizes. This combination of technical precision and visual warmth makes Bernardo Moda suitable for a wide range of applications, from corporate branding to digital interfaces. The font's clean lines and contemporary feel evoke a sense of professionalism and sophistication, while its subtle humanist touches prevent it from feeling overly sterile. It's a versatile typeface that can be used to create a variety of moods, from playful and energetic to serious and refined.",
