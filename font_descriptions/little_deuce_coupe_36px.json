    "detailed_description": "Little Venice Coupe is a bold, geometric sans-serif typeface with a distinct retro-futuristic feel. Its construction is based on strong, clean lines and sharp angles, reminiscent of mid-century modern design. The letters are built with a consistent stroke weight, creating a sense of solidity and confidence. The unique feature of this font is its double-outline, which adds a layer of depth and dimension, giving it a three-dimensional quality. This outline is not simply a decorative element; it enhances legibility by creating a clear visual separation between the letters, especially at smaller sizes. The font's overall character is bold and assertive, yet approachable due to the slight rounding of the terminals, which softens the sharp edges. This balance makes it suitable for a variety of applications, from bold headlines and branding to digital interfaces and even retro-inspired designs. The font's cultural associations lean towards a nostalgic yet futuristic aesthetic, evoking a sense of optimism and progress, reminiscent of the space age and the rise of technology. It's a versatile typeface that can be used to create a strong visual impact while maintaining a sense of approachability and playfulness.",
