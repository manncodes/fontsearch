    "detailed_description": "Great Sejagad is a bold, expressive script font that captures the energy of hand-lettering. Its flowing strokes and dynamic angles create a sense of movement and personality. The font's construction is based on a combination of calligraphic principles and contemporary design sensibilities. The letters are formed with a clear understanding of stroke weight and direction, resulting in a visually appealing and legible typeface. The font's distinctive features include its exaggerated letterforms, particularly in the lowercase 'a' and 'g', which add a playful and whimsical touch. The overall character of Great Sejagad is energetic and optimistic, with a touch of irreverence. It evokes a sense of spontaneity and creativity, making it suitable for projects that require a bold and expressive voice. The font's contemporary relevance lies in its ability to capture the spirit of modern design trends, while still retaining a classic calligraphic feel. It is well-suited for branding, packaging, and digital applications where a strong visual impact is desired. The font's technical limitations include its potential for legibility issues at smaller sizes, as the exaggerated letterforms can become difficult to discern. However, its strong character and versatility make it a valuable tool for designers seeking to add a unique and memorable touch to their projects.",
